      CHAPTER I
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">I</span>t was Sir Francis
      Jeune, afterwards Lord St. Helier, and President of the Divorce Court, who
      first called attention to the strange significance of the Eighth Year of
      married life. &ldquo;The Eighth Year,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;is the most dangerous year in
      the adventure of marriage.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Afterwards, in the recent Royal Commission on Divorce, this curious fact
      was again alluded to in the evidence, and it has been shown by statistics
      of domestic tragedy, by hundreds of sordid little dramas, that at this
      period in the partnership of husbands and wives there comes, in many
      cases, a great crisis, leading often to moral disaster.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is in the Eighth Year, or thereabouts, that there is the tug-of-war
      between two temperaments, mated by the law, but not mated, perhaps, in
      ideals, in ambitions, or in qualities of character. The man and woman pull
      against each other, tugging at each other&rsquo;s heartstrings. The Eighth Year
      is the fatal year, when if there is no give-and-take, no working
      compromise, no new pledges of loyalty and comradeship, the foundations of
      the home are shattered, and the hopes with which it was first built lie in
      ruins like a house of cards knocked down by a gust of wind.
    </p>
    <p>
      But why the Eighth Year? Why not the twelfth, fourteenth, or eighteenth
      year? The answer is not to be found in any old superstition. There is
      nothing uncanny about the number eight. The problem is not to be shrugged
      off by people who despise the foolish old tradition which clings to
      thirteen, and imagine this to be in the same class of folly. By the law of
      averages and by undeniable statistics it has been proved that it brings
      many broken-hearted men and women to the Divorce Court. For instance,
      taking the annual average of divorces in England between 1904 and 1908,
      one finds that there were only six divorces between husbands and wives who
      had been married less than a year, and only eighteen divorces between
      those married less than two years. Between the second and the fifth years
      the number increases to a hundred and seventeen. Then there is a
      tremendous jump, and the numbers between the fifth and tenth years are two
      hundred and ninety-two. The period of the Eighth Year is the most
      productive of divorce. The figures are more startling and more significant
      when they cover a longer period. But apart from statistics and apart
      altogether from the Divorce Court, which is only one house of trouble, by
      using one&rsquo;s own eyes in one&rsquo;s own circle of friends one may see that young
      married couples who started happily enough show signs of stress and strain
      as this year approaches. The fact is undeniable. What is the cause behind
      the fact?
    </p>
    <p>
      There is not one cause, there are many causes, all leading up from the
      first day of marriage, inevitably, with the unswerving, relentless
      fatality of Greek Tragedy to the Eighth Year. They are causes which lie
      deep in the social system of our modern home life; in the little order of
      things prevailing, at this time, in hundreds of thousands of small
      households and small flats, inhabited by the middle-classes. It is mainly
      a middle-class problem, because the rich and the poor are, for reasons
      which I will show later in this argument, exempt in a large measure from
      the fatality of the Eighth Year. But all the influences at work among the
      middle-classes, in this strange age of intellectual disturbance, and of
      blind gropings forward to new social and moral conditions, have a close
      hearing upon this seeming mystery. The economic position of this class,
      its social ambitions, its intellectual adventures, its general education,
      its code of morality, its religion or lack of religion, its little
      conventional cults, the pressure of outside influences, thrusting inwards
      to the hidden life in these little homes, bringing dangerous ideas through
      the front doors, or through the keyholes, and all the mental and moral
      vibrations that are &ldquo;in the air&rdquo; to-day, especially in the air breathed by
      the middle-classes, produce&mdash;the Eighth Year.
    </p>
    <p>
      Let us start with the first year of marriage so that we may see how the
      problem works out from the beginning.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here we have, in the first year, a young man and woman who have come
      together, not through any overmastering force of passion, but as
      middle-class men and women are mostly brought together, by the accidents
      of juxtaposition, and by a pleasant sentiment. They met, before marriage,
      at tennis parties, at suburban dances, at evening At Homes. By the laws of
      natural selection, aided a little by anxious mothers, this young man and
      this young woman find out, or think they find out, that they are &ldquo;suited&rdquo;
       to each other. That is to say, the young man thrills in a pleasant way in
      the presence of the girl, and she sees the timidity in his eyes when she
      looks at him, and she knows that her laughter, the touch of her hand, the
      little tricks and graces she has learnt from girl-friends, or from
      actresses in musical comedy, or from instinct, attract him to her. She
      leads him on, by absurd little tiffs, artfully arranged, by a pretence of
      flirtation with other boys, by provocative words, by moments of tenderness
      changing abruptly to sham indifference, or followed by little shafts of
      satire which wound his pride, and sting him into desire for her. He
      pursues her, not knowing that he is pursued, so that they meet half-way.
      This affair makes him restless, ill at ease. It interrupts his work and
      his ambitions. Presently it becomes an obsession, and he knows that he has
      &ldquo;fallen in love.&rdquo; He makes his plans accordingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the middle-classes love still presupposes marriage (though the idea is
      not so fast-rooted as in the old days), but how the dickens is he to
      manage it? He is just starting his career as Something in the City, or as
      a solicitor, barrister, journalist, artist, doctor. His income is barely
      sufficient for himself, according to his way of life, which includes
      decent clothes, a club, a game of golf when he feels like it, a
      motor-cycle or a small car, a holiday abroad, theatres, a bachelor dinner
      now and again&mdash;the usual thing. He belongs to the younger generation,
      with wider interests, larger ideas, higher ambitions than those with which
      his father and mother started life.
    </p>
    <p>
      He could not start on their level. Times have changed. He remembers his
      father&rsquo;s reminiscences of early struggles, of the ceaseless anxiety to
      make both ends meet, of the continual stinting and scraping to keep the
      children &ldquo;decent,&rdquo; to provide them with a good education, to give them a
      fair start in life. He remembers his mother in his own childhood. She was
      always mending stockings. There was always a litter of needlework on the
      dining-room table after supper.
    </p>
    <p>
      There were times when she &ldquo;did&rdquo; without a maid, and exhausted herself with
      domestic drudgery. There were no foreign holidays then, only a week or two
      at the seaside once a year. There was precious little pocket money for the
      boys. They were conscious of their shabby gentility, and hated it.
    </p>
    <p>
      The modern young man looks with a kind of horror upon all this domestic
      squalor, as he calls it. He couldn&rsquo;t stand it. If marriage means that for
      him he will have none of it. But need it mean that? He and Winifred will
      scheme out their lives differently. They will leave out the baby side of
      the business&mdash;until they can afford to indulge in it. They will live
      in a little flat, and furnish it, if necessary, on the hire system. They
      will cut out the domestic drudgery. They will enjoy the fun of life, and
      shelve the responsibilities until they are able to pay for them. After all
      it will not be long before he is earning a good income. He has got his
      feet on the first rang of the ladder, and, with a little luck&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      So he proposes to the girl, and she pretends to be immensely surprised,
      though she has been eating her heart out while he hesitated, and delayed,
      and pondered. They pledge each other, &ldquo;till death do us part,&rdquo; and the
      girl, who has been reading a great many novels lately, is very happy
      because her own plot is working out according to the rules of romance.
    </p>
    <p>
      They live in a world of romance before the marriage day. The man seems to
      walk on air when he crosses London Bridge on his way to the City. Or if he
      is a barrister he sees the beauty of his girl&rsquo;s face in his brief&mdash;and
      is in danger of losing his case. Or if a journalist he curses his
      irregular hours which keep him from the little house in Tulse Hill, or the
      flat in Hampstead, where there is a love-light in the windows. He knows
      the outward look of the girl, her softness, her prettiness, her shy glance
      when he greets her. He knows her teasing ways, her tenderness, her
      vivacity. Only now and then he is startled by her stupidity, or by her
      innocence, or by her ignorance, or&mdash;still more startling&mdash;by her
      superior wisdom of the ways of the world, by her shrewd little words, by a
      sudden revelation of knowledge about things which girls are not supposed
      to know.
    </p>
    <p>
      But these things do not count. Only sentiment and romance are allowed to
      count. These two people who are about to start on the long road of life
      together are utterly blind to each other&rsquo;s vices or virtues. They are
      deeply ignorant of each other&rsquo;s soul. They know nothing of the real man or
      the real woman hidden beneath the mask of social conventions, beneath the
      delightful, sham of romantic affection. They know nothing of their own
      souls, nor of the strength that is in them to stand the test of life&rsquo;s
      realities. They know nothing of their own weakness.
    </p>
    <p>
      So they marry.
    </p>
    <p>
      And for the first year they are wonderfully happy. For the first year is
      full of excitement. They thrill to the great adventure of marriage. They
      are uplifted with passionate love which seems likely to last for ever.
      They have a thousand little interests. Even the trivialities of
      domesticity are immensely important. Even the little disasters of
      domesticity are amusing. They find a lot of laughter in life. They laugh
      at the absurd mistakes of the servant-maids who follow in quick
      succession. They laugh at their own ridiculous miscalculations with regard
      to the expense of house-keeping. They laugh when visitors call at awkward
      moments and when the dinner is spoilt by an inefficient cook. After all,
      the comradeship of a young man and wife is the best thing in life, and
      nothing else seems to matter. They are such good comrades that the husband
      never leaves his wife a moment in his leisure time. He takes her to the
      theatre with him. They spend week-ends together, far from the madding
      crowd. They pluck the flowers of life, hand in hand, as lovers. The first
      year merges into the second. Not yet do they know each other.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER II
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">I</span>t is in the third
      and fourth year that they begin to find each other out. The bright fires
      of their passion have died down, burning with a fitful glow, burning low.
      Until then they had been lovers to each other, hidden from each other by
      the illusions of romantic love. It was inconceivable that the man could be
      anything but kind, and tender, and patient, and considerate. It was
      inconceivable that he could hold any but the noblest ideals, the most
      exalted aspirations, the most generous sentiments. He had been so wise, so
      witty, and so gay.
    </p>
    <p>
      And to the man it had seemed that the woman by his side was gifted with
      all the virtues. At least she had been eager to please him, to satisfy his
      least desire, to bend to his will. She had pandered to his vanity, fed his
      self-conceit, listened to his opinions on all the subjects of life as
      though they were inspired. If he had been kept out late at work he had
      found her waiting for him, quick to put her arms about him, to cry out,
      &ldquo;Oh, my poor dear, how tired you must be?&rdquo; She had been grateful to him
      for all his little gifts, for all his words of love. And he had seen her
      as a beautiful thing, without flaw or blemish. He had worshipped at the
      foot of the pedestal on which he had placed her in his ideals.
    </p>
    <p>
      But now both the husband and wife begin to see each other, not as lovers,
      but as man and woman. It is rather disturbing. It is distressing to the
      young wife to discover, gradually, by a series of little accidents, that
      this man with whom she has to live all her life is not made of different
      clay from other men, that he is made of the same clay. One by one all the
      little romantic illusions out of which she had built up the false image of
      him, from the heroes of sentimental fiction, from the dreams of girlhood,
      are stripped from him, until he stands bare before her, the natural man.
      She does not like the natural man at first. It is quite a long time before
      she can reconcile herself to the thought that she is mated to a natural
      man, with a touch of brutality, with little meannesses, with moods of
      irritability, with occasional bad tempers, when he uses bad words. She
      sees, too clearly for her spiritual comfort, that they are not
      &ldquo;twin-souls.&rdquo; They have not been made in the same mould. His childhood was
      different from her childhood, his upbringing from her upbringing. She sees
      that in little things&mdash;mere trifles, but monstrously annoying, such
      as his untidy habits, the carelessness with which he flicks his cigarette
      ash about the carpet, the familiarity with which he speaks to the
      servant-maid. She begins to dislike some of his personal habits&mdash;the
      way in which he sneezes, his habit of shaving after breakfast instead of
      before breakfast, his habit of reading the newspaper at the breakfast
      table instead of chatting with her as he used to do about the programme
      for the day. In things less trivial she finds out that her first ideal of
      him was false. They do not think alike on the great subjects of life. He
      is a Radical and she is Conservative, by education and upbringing. It
      hurts her when he argues with revolutionary ideas which seem to her
      positively wicked, and subversive of all morality. He has loose views
      about morality in general, and is very tolerant about lapses from the
      old-fashioned moral code. That hurts her too&mdash;horribly. It begins to
      undermine the foundations of her faith in what used to seem the essential
      truth of things. But, above all, it hurts her to realize that she and her
      husband are not one, in mind and body, but utterly different, in
      temperament, in their outlook on life, in their fundamental principles and
      ideas.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the other side the husband makes unpleasant discoveries. He finds out,
      with a shock, that he was utterly ignorant of the girl whom he asked to be
      his wife, and that this woman who sits at his breakfast-table is not the
      same woman as the one who dwelt in his imagination, even as the one who
      lived with him during the first and second year. She has lost her coyness,
      her little teasing ways, her girlish vivacity. She begins to surprise him
      by a hard common-sense, and no longer responds so easily to his old
      romantic moods. He can no longer be certain of her smiles and her
      tenderness when he speaks the old love-words. She begins to challenge his
      authority, not deliberately, nor openly, but by ignoring his hints, or by
      disregarding his advice.
    </p>
    <p>
      She even challenges his opinions, and that is a shock to him. It is a blow
      to his vanity.
    </p>
    <p>
      It takes down his self-conceit more than a peg or two, especially when he
      has to acknowledge, secretly, that she is in the right, as sometimes
      happens. He finds out faults in her now&mdash;a touch of selfishness, a
      trace of arrogance, an irritability of temper of which he has to be
      careful, especially when she is in a nervous state of health. They begin
      to quarrel rather frequently about absurd things, about things that do not
      matter a brass farthing. Some of these quarrels reach passionate heights
      and leave them both exhausted, wondering rather blankly what it was all
      about. Then the wife cries a little, and the husband kisses her.
    </p>
    <p>
      By the end of the fourth year they know each other pretty well.

      CHAPTER III
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">I</span>n the fifth and
      sixth years they have settled down to the jog-trot of the married life.
      Not yet do they see the shadow of the Eighth Year looming ahead. They have
      faced the reality of life, and knowing each other as they really are have
      made a working compromise. Their love has steadied down to a more even
      flame, and passion is almost extinguished. They have decided to play the
      game, according to the creed of their class, exactly as their neighbors
      are playing it.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is largely a game of bluff, as it is played in thousands of small
      households. It is a game, also, of consequences, as I shall have to show.
      It consists in keeping up appearances, in going one better than one&rsquo;s
      neighbor whenever possible, and in making a claim to a higher rung of the
      social ladder than is justified by the husband&rsquo;s income and rank in life.
      It is the creed of snobbishness. For this creed everything is sacrificed&mdash;contentment
      of mind, the pleasure of life, the little children of life.
    </p>
    <p>
      In many flats of Intellectual Mansions, and even in the small houses of
      the &ldquo;well-to-do&rdquo; suburbs, children do not enter into the scheme of things.
      The &ldquo;babies have been left out of the business.&rdquo; For people who are
      keeping up appearances to the last penny of their income cannot afford to
      be burdened by babies. Besides, they interfere seriously with social
      ladder-climbing, drag down a married couple of the younger generation to
      the domestic squalor of their parents&rsquo; early life. The husband cannot bear
      the thought that his wife should have to make beds in the morning and mend
      stockings in the evening, and wheel out a perambulator in the park. It is
      so very &ldquo;low down.&rdquo; The husband wants to save his wife from all this
      domestic drudgery. He wants her to look pretty in the frocks he buys her.
      He wants her to wear more expensive frocks than any other woman in his
      circle of friends. He likes to hear his friends say, &ldquo;How charming your
      wife looks to-night, old man!&rdquo; and to hear elderly ladies say to his wife,
      &ldquo;What a beautiful gown you are wearing, my dear!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He is working hard now in order to furnish his wife&rsquo;s wardrobe&mdash;not
      only for her pleasure, but for his pride. After the first romance of love,
      ambition comes to gild reality. He is ambitious to build up a beautiful
      little home. The furniture with which they started married life on the
      hire system has been bought and paid for, and is now replaced here and
      there by &ldquo;genuine antiques.&rdquo; He puts some good prints on his walls and
      buys some water-color sketches, and becomes in a small way a patron of the
      arts. It is pleasant during one of his wife&rsquo;s evening At Homes to take a
      guest on one side and say &ldquo;What do you think of that? Pretty good, eh?
      It&rsquo;s an original, by Verdant Green, you know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He has urged upon his wife the necessity of giving <i>recherché</i> little
      dinners, to which he can invite friends better off than himself, and
      distinguished guests whom he wishes to impress. As he explains to his
      wife, &ldquo;one has to do these things.&rdquo; And he does them rather well, paying
      some attention to his wines&mdash;he keeps a good dinner claret&mdash;and
      to his cigars, which he buys at the stores. He also suggests to his wife
      that now she has an extra servant she had better establish a weekly At
      Home, an informal little affair, but pleasant and useful, because it shows
      the world, their world, that they are getting on in the social scale. Here
      again, distinguished visitors may be invited to &ldquo;drop in.&rdquo; It is good for
      business. A pretty, well-dressed wife makes a favourable impression upon
      solicitors who have briefs to give away or upon wealthy clients. One must
      keep up appearances, and make a good show. Besides, it is pleasant to put
      on evening clothes after a hard day&rsquo;s work and to play the host. It gives
      a man some return for all his toil. It gives him a reason for living. And
      it brightens up one&rsquo;s home-life. &ldquo;Man does not live by bread alone,&rdquo; he
      must have some cakes and ale, so to speak.
    </p>
    <p>
      But it is expensive. As every year of marriage passes, the expenses
      increase, steadily, miraculously. It is difficult to account for them, but
      there they are, facing a man in his quarterly reckoning. And the two ends
      must be made to meet, by extra work, by putting one&rsquo;s nose down to the
      grindstone. The husband does not come home so soon as he used to do in the
      early days. But he has the satisfaction of knowing that while he is away
      at work his wife is keeping up his social reputation and doing all the
      things which a lady in her station of life is expected to do. He thanks
      heaven that his wife is happy.
    </p>
    <p>
      She is not unhappy, this wife, in the fifth and sixth year of marriage.
      After the first romantic illusions failed her she settled down quietly
      enough to play the game. It is quite interesting, quite amusing. Now and
      again queer doubts assail her, and she has strange flutterings at the
      heart, and little pinpricks of conscience. It is about the question of
      motherhood. Perhaps it would be better for her to have a baby. However,
      she has threshed out the question a hundred times with her husband, and he
      has decided that he cannot afford a family yet, and after all the flat <i>is</i>
      very small. Besides, she shirks the idea herself&mdash;all the pain of it,
      and the trouble of it.... She thrusts down these queer doubts, does not
      listen to the flutterings at the heart, ignores the little pinpricks of
      conscience. She turns quickly to the interests of her social life and
      falls easily into the habit of pleasant laziness, filling her day with
      little futile things, which seem to satisfy her heart and brain. When her
      husband has gone to business she dresses herself rather elaborately for a
      morning stroll, manicures her nails, tries a new preparation for the
      complexion, alters a feather, or a flower, in one of her hats, studies
      herself in the glass, and is pleased with herself. It passes the time.
      Then she saunters forth, and goes to the shops, peering in through the
      great plate-glass windows at the latest display of lingerie, of evening
      gowns, of millinery. She fancies herself in some of the new hats from
      Paris. One or two of them attract her especially. She makes a mental note
      of them. She will ask her husband to let her buy one of them. After all
      Mrs. Fitzmaurice had a new hat only last week&mdash;the second in one
      month. She will tell him that. It will pique him, for there is a rather
      amusing rivalry between the Fitzmaurices and them.
    </p>
    <p>
      So the morning passes until luncheon, when she props the morning newspaper
      against the water-jug, reading the titbits of news and the fashion page
      while she eats her meal, rather nicely cooked by the new servant, and
      daintily served by the little housemaid. Another hour of the day passes,
      and it is the afternoon.
    </p>
    <p>
      She lies down for half an hour with the latest novel from Mudie&rsquo;s. It has
      a good plot, and is a rather exciting love-story. It brings back romance
      to her. For a little while she forgets the reality which she has learnt
      since her own romantic days. Here love is exactly what she imagined it to
      he, thrilling, joyous, never-changing. The hero is exactly what she
      imagined her husband to be&mdash;before he was her husband&mdash;strong,
      gentle, noble, high-souled, immensely patient. And after many little
      troubles, misadventures, cross-purposes, and strange happenings, marriage
      is the great reward, the splendid compensation. After this the hero and
      heroine live happily ever afterwards, till death does them part, and&mdash;there
      is nothing more to be said. The novel ends with the marriage bells.
    </p>
    <p>
      She knows that her novel has not ended with the marriage hells, that, in
      fact, the plot is only just beginning as far as she is concerned. But she
      does not allow herself to think of that. She revels in romantic fiction,
      and reads novel after novel at the rate of three a week. Occasionally one
      of these novels gives her a nasty shock, for it deals with realism rather
      than romance, and reveals the hearts of women rather like herself, and the
      tragedies of women rather like herself, and the truth of things, in a
      cold, white light. She reads the book with burning eyes. It makes her
      pulse beat. It seems rather a wicked book, it is so horribly truthful, not
      covering even the nakedness of facts with a decent layer of sentiment, but
      exposing them brutally, with a terrible candor. She hates the book. It
      makes her think of things she has tried to forget. It revives those queer
      doubts, and makes her conscience prick again. She is glad when she has
      sent it back to the library and taken out another novel, of the harmless
      kind, in the old style. She lulls her conscience to sleep by the dear old
      love-stories, or by the musical comedies and the costume-plays to which
      she goes with one of her girl-friends on Wednesday or Saturday matinées.
    </p>
    <p>
      She goes to the theatre a good deal now, because she is living more
      independently of her husband. That is to say she no longer waits for his
      home-coming, as in her first days of marriage, with an impatient desire.
      She has long seen that they cannot be all in all to each other, sharing
      all pleasures, or having none. He has realized that, too, and goes to his
      club at least once a week&mdash;sometimes more often, to enjoy the society
      of men, to get a little &ldquo;Bohemianism,&rdquo; as he calls it.
    </p>
    <p>
      She has made her own circle of friends now, the young wives of men like
      her husband, and many of her afternoons are taken up with little rounds of
      visits, when she is amused by the tittle-tattle of these wives, by their
      little tales and scandals, by their gossips about servants, frocks and
      theatres.
    </p>
    <p>
      She, too, has social ambitions like her husband. Her evenings At Home are
      agreeable adventures when she is pleased with the homage of her husband&rsquo;s
      friends. She takes some trouble with her little dinner-parties and writes
      out the <i>menus</i> with a good deal of care, and arranges the flowers,
      and occasionally looks into the kitchen to give a word to the cook. She
      wears her new evening gown and smiles at her husband&rsquo;s compliments, with
      something of her old tenderness. After one of these evening At Homes the
      husband and wife have moments of loving comradeship like those in the
      first days of their marriage. It is a pity that some trivial accident or
      dispute causes ill-temper at the breakfast-table.
    </p>
    <p>
      But, on the whole, they play the game rather well in the fifth and sixth
      years of their married life. The husband takes the rough with the smooth.
      In spite of occasional bad tempers, in spite of grievances which are
      growing into habits of mind, he is a good fellow and&mdash;he thanks
      heaven his wife is happy.

      CHAPTER IV
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">I</span>t is the seventh
      year. The wife is still doing exactly what she did in the fifth and sixth
      years. Her daily routine is exactly the same. Except that she can afford
      extra little luxuries now, and indulge in more expensive kinds of pleasure&mdash;stalls
      at the theatre instead of seats in the pit, an occasional visit to the
      opera, an easy yielding to temptations in the way of hats. Her husband has
      been &ldquo;getting on,&rdquo; and he is glad to give her what she wants.
    </p>
    <p>
      But somehow or other she is beginning to realize that she has not got what
      she wants. She does not know what she wants, but she knows that there is a
      great lack of something in her life. She is still &ldquo;playing the game,&rdquo; but
      there is no longer the same sport in it. The sharp edge of her interest in
      things has worn off. It has been dulled down. She goes languidly through
      the days and a matinée jaunt no longer thrills her with a little
      excitement. The plays are so boring, full of stale old plots, stale old
      women, stale old tricks. She is sick of them. She still reads a great
      number of romantic novels, but how insufferably tedious they have become!
      How false they are! How cloying is all this sickly sentiment! She searches
      about for the kind of novel which used to frighten her, problem novels,
      dangerous novels, novels dealing with real problems of life. They still
      frighten her a little, some of them, but she likes the sensation. She
      wants more of it. She wants to plunge deeper into the dangerous problems,
      to get nearer to the truth of things. She broods over their revelations.
      She searches out the meaning of their suggestions, their hints, their
      innuendoes. It is like drug-drinking. This poisonous fiction stimulates
      her for a little while, until the effect of it has worn off and leaves her
      with an aching head. Her head often aches now. And her heart aches&mdash;though
      goodness knows why. Everything is so stale. The gossip of her women
      friends is, oh&mdash;so stale! She has heard all their stories about all
      their servants, all their philosophy about the servant problem in general,
      all their shallow little views about life, and love, and marriage. She has
      found them all out, their vanities, their little selfish ways, their
      little lies and shams and fooleries. They are exactly like herself. She
      has been brought up in the same code, shaped in the same mould, cut out to
      the same pattern. Their ideas are her ideas. Their ways of life her ways.
      They bore her exceedingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      She is bored by things which for a time were very pleasant. It is, for
      instance, boring to go shopping in the morning. It is annoying to her to
      see her own wistful, moody eyes in the plate-glass windows, and in the
      pier-glasses. She has not lost her love of pretty frocks and pretty
      things, but it bores her to think that her husband does not notice them so
      much, and that she has to wear them mostly to please herself. She is tired
      of the little compliments paid to her by her husband&rsquo;s middle-aged
      friends. She has begun to find her husband&rsquo;s friends very dull people
      indeed. Most of all is she bored by those evening At Homes with their
      familiar ritual&mdash;the girl who wants to sing but pleads a bad cold,
      the woman who wants to play but says she is so fearfully &ldquo;out of
      practice,&rdquo; the man who asks the name of a piece which he has heard a score
      of times, the well-worn jokes, the well-known opinions on things which do
      not matter, the light refreshments, the thanks for &ldquo;a pleasant evening.&rdquo;
       Oh, those pleasant evenings! How she hates them!
    </p>
    <p>
      She is beginning to hate this beautiful little home of hers. The very
      pictures on the walls set her nerves on edge. She has stared at them so
      often. She wishes to goodness that Marcus Stone&rsquo;s lovers on an
      old-fashioned stone seat would go and drown themselves in the distant
      lake. But they do not move. They sit smirking at each other, eternally.
      She wishes with all her heart that the big Newfoundland dog over there
      would bite the fluffy haired child who says &ldquo;Does &lsquo;oo talk?&rdquo; But it will
      not even bark. She stares at the pattern on the carpet, when a Mudie&rsquo;s
      novel lies on her lap, and comes to detest the artificial roses on the
      trellis-work. She digs her heels into one of them. If the roses were real
      she would pluck them leaf by leaf and scatter the floor with them. The
      ticking of the clock on the mantelshelf irritates her. It seems a reproach
      to her. It seems to be counting up her waste of time.
    </p>
    <p>
      She stays more at home, in spite of hating it, because she is beginning to
      loathe her round of visits. She feels lonely and wishes her husband would
      come home. Why does he stay so late at the office now? Surely it isn&rsquo;t
      necessary? When he comes home she is so snappy and irritable that he
      becomes silent over the dinner-table, and then she quarrels with him for
      his silence. After dinner he sits over his papers, thinking out some
      knotty point of business, which he does not discuss with her as in the old
      days. He buries his nose in the evening paper, and reads all the
      advertisements, and is very dull and uninteresting. Yet she nourishes a
      grievance when he goes off on his club-nights and comes home in the early
      hours of the morning, cheerful and talkative when she wants to go to
      sleep.

      CHAPTER V
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">I</span>n some cases,
      indeed in many cases, the presence of an &ldquo;outsider&rdquo; adds to the
      unhappiness of the wife and divides her still more from her husband. It is
      the presence of the mother-in-law.
    </p>
    <p>
      She, poor soul, has had a terrible time, and no one until now has said a
      good word for her. The red-nosed comedian of the music-hall has used her
      for his most gross vulgarities, sure that whenever he mentions her name he
      will raise guffaws from the gallery, and evoke shrieks of ill-natured
      merriment from young women in the pit. In the pantomimes the man dressed
      up as a woman indulges in long monologues upon his mother-in-law as the
      source of all domestic unhappiness, as the origin of all quarrels between
      husbands and wives, as the greatest nuisance in modern life, and so long
      as he patters about the mother-in-law the audience enjoys itself vastly.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is idle to pretend that the mother-in-law is a blessing in a small
      household. I am bound to admit that the success of the rednosed comedian
      who uses her as his text is due to the truth which lies hidden beneath his
      absurdity. He raises roars of laughter because the people who make up his
      audience realize that he is giving a touch of humor to something which is
      a grim tragedy, and according to the psychology of humor this is
      irresistibly comic, just as the most primitive and laughter-compelling
      jokes deal with corpses, and funerals, and death made ridiculous. They
      have suffered from their own mothers-in-law, those elderly women who sit
      in the corner with watchful eyes upon the young wives, those critics of
      their sons&rsquo; marriages, those eavesdroppers of the first quarrel, and of
      all the quarrels that follow the first, those oracles of unwelcome wisdom,
      whose advice about household affairs, about the way of dealing with the
      domestic servants, with constant references to <i>their</i> young days,
      are a daily exasperation to young married women.
    </p>
    <p>
      All that is painfully true. In many cases the mother-in-law becomes so
      terrible an incubus in small households that domestic servants leave with
      unfailing regularity before their month is &ldquo;up,&rdquo; husbands make a habit of
      being late at the office, and wives are seriously tempted to take to
      drink.
    </p>
    <p>
      But what of the mother-in-law herself? Is <i>she</i> to be envied? Did she
      willingly become a mother-in-law? Alas, her tragedy is as great as that of
      the young wife upon whose nerves she gets so badly, as great as that of
      the young husband who finds his home-life insufferable because of her
      presence.
    </p>
    <p>
      For the mother-in-law is a prisoner of fate. She is the unwanted guest.
      She is dependent upon the charity of those who find her a daily nuisance.
      During the days of her own married life she devoted herself to her husband
      and children, stinted and scraped for them, moulded them according to her
      ideals of righteousness, exacted obedience to her motherly commands, and
      was sure of their love. Then, one day, death knocked at the door, and
      brought black horses into the street. After that day, when her man was
      taken from her, she became dependent upon her eldest son, but did not yet
      feel the slavery of the dependence.
    </p>
    <p>
      For he paid the debt of gratitude gratefully, and kept up the little home.
    </p>
    <p>
      But one day she noticed that he did not come home so early, and that when
      he came home he was absent-minded. He fell into the habit of spending his
      evenings out, and his mother wondered, and was anxious. He was not so
      careful about her comforts, and she was hurt. Then one day he came home
      and said, &ldquo;Mother, I am going to get married,&rdquo; and she knew that her
      happiness was at an end. For she knew, with a mother&rsquo;s intuition, that the
      love which had been in her boy&rsquo;s heart for her must now be shared with
      another woman, and that instead of having the first place in his life, she
      would have the second place.
    </p>
    <p>
      For a little while her jealousy is like that of a woman robbed of her
      lover. She hides it, and hides her hate for that girl whose simpering
      smile, whose prettiness, whose coy behavior, light fires in her son&rsquo;s
      eyes, and set his pulse beating, and make him forgetful of his mother.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then the marriage takes place and the mother who has dreaded the day knows
      that it is her funeral. For she is like a queen whose prerogatives and
      privileges have been taken away by the death of the king, and by the
      accession of a new queen. Her place is taken from her. Her home is broken
      up. She is moved, with the furniture, into the new home, put into the
      second-best bedroom, and arranged to suit the convenience of the new
      household in which another woman is mistress.
    </p>
    <p>
      She knows already that she has begun to be a nuisance, and it is like a
      sharp dagger in her heart. She knows that the young wife is as jealous of
      her as she is of the young wife, because her son cannot break himself of
      the habit of obedience, cannot give up that respect for his mother&rsquo;s
      principles and advice and wisdom, which is part of the very fibre of his
      being, because in any domestic crisis the son turns more readily to the
      mother than to the young woman who is a newcomer in his life, and in any
      domestic quarrel he takes the mother&rsquo;s part rather than the wife&rsquo;s. It is
      the law of nature. It cannot be altered, but it is the cause of
      heartburning and squalid little tragedies.
    </p>
    <p>
      The mother-in-law, in the corner of the sitting-room, watches the drama of
      the married life, and with more experience of life, because of her years,
      sees the young wife do foolish things, watches her blundering experiments
      in the great adventure of marriage, is vigilant of her failures in
      housekeeping, and in the management of her husband. She cannot be quite
      tongue-tied. She cannot refrain from criticism, advice, rebuke. Between
      the mother-in-law and the daughter-in-law there is a daily warfare of
      pinpricks, a feud that grows bitter with the years.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the mother-in-law is helpless. She cannot escape from the lamentable
      situation. She must always remain a hindrance, because she needs a roof
      over her head, and there is no other roof, and she is dependent for her
      daily bread upon the son who is faithful to her, though he is irritable,
      moody and sharp of speech, because of the fretfulness of his wife.
    </p>
    <p>
      This is the eternal tragedy of the mother-in-law, which is turned into a
      jest by the red-nosed comedian to get the laughter from &ldquo;the gods.&rdquo; It is
      also a tragedy to the daughter-in-law, who could shriek aloud sometimes
      when the presence of the elderly woman becomes intolerable.
    </p>
    <p>
      Many things are becoming intolerable to the young wife. Her nerves are out
      of order. Sometimes she feels &ldquo;queer.&rdquo; She cannot explain how queer she
      feels, even to herself. She says bitter things to her husband, and then
      hates herself for doing so. She has a great yearning for his love, but is
      very cold when he is in a tender mood. She cannot understand her own
      moods. She only knows that she is beginning to get frightened when she
      thinks of the long vista of years before her. She cannot go on like this
      always. She cannot go on like this very long. She is getting rather
      hysterical. She startles her husband by laughing in a queer shrill way
      when he expresses some serious opinions, or gives vent to some of his
      conventional philosophy, about women, and the duties of married life, and
      the abomination of the Suffragettes. But he does not see her tears. He
      does not see her one day, when suddenly, after she has been reading a
      Mudie&rsquo;s novel, page after page, without understanding one word, tears well
      up into her eyes, and fall upon the pages, until she bends her head down
      and puts her hands up to her face, and sobs as though all her heart had
      turned to tears.

      CHAPTER VI
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">I</span><i>t is the Eighth
      Year</i>. The wife does not know the significance of that. The husband
      goes on his way without seeing the ghosts that have invaded his little
      household. He is too busy to see. The whole energy of his mind now is
      devoted to the business of his life. He must earn money, more money, still
      more money, because expenses still keep increasing, by leaps and bounds.
      He finds it more and more difficult to cut his coat according to his
      cloth. He is often surprised because with a much larger income he seems to
      be just as &ldquo;hard up&rdquo; as when he started the adventure of marriage. He
      wonders, sometimes, whether the game is worth the candle. What does he get
      out of it? Precious little. Not much fun. In the evenings he is tired,
      although his brain is still worrying over the details of his work, over
      his business disappointments and difficulties, and plans. Now and again he
      is surprised at the strange quietude and lassitude of his wife. He catches
      a look of tragedy in her eyes, and it startles him for a moment, so that
      he asks her if she is feeling unwell. She laughs, in a mirthless way, and
      seems to resent the question. &ldquo;Perfectly well, thanks,&rdquo; she says. He
      shrugs his shoulders. He cannot bother about a woman&rsquo;s whims and moods.
      Women are queer kittle-cattle. He can&rsquo;t make &lsquo;em out. Even his own wife is
      a perfect mystery to him. It is a pity they get on each other&rsquo;s nerves so
      much. What more does she want? He has given her everything a woman may
      desire&mdash;a beautiful little home, many little luxuries, plenty of
      pin-money. He does not stint her. It is he that does the stinting. He is
      always working for her so that she may play. However&mdash;work is best.
      To do our job in life is the best philosophy.
    </p>
    <p>
      So the husband has on one side the passing suspicion that something is
      wrong with his wife, and the wife hides her heart from him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Something <i>is</i> wrong with her. Everything is wrong, though she does
      not know why and how. She feels lonely&mdash;horribly lonely in spite of
      all her friends. She feels like a woman alone in a great desert with no
      other human soul near her, thrust back upon her own thoughts, brooding
      over her own misery. There is a great emptiness in her heart, and she has
      a great hunger and a great thirst of soul which she cannot satisfy.
      Nothing satisfies that empty, barren heart of hers, that throbbing brain.
      She has finished with Mudie&rsquo;s novels. She can find no satisfaction in <i>them</i>.
      She revolts from the tittle-tattle of her women friends. That is no longer
      amusing. She finds no pleasure in the beauty of her face. It is no longer
      beautiful. She hates the sight of her face in the glass. She is afraid of
      those big wistful eyes which stare at her. She is sick to death of
      dressing herself up. How futile it is! How utterly vain and foolish!
    </p>
    <p>
      She is haunted with ghosts; the ghosts of What-Might-Have-Been. They
      whisper about her, so that she puts her hands to her ears, when she is
      alone in her drawing-room. Faces peer at her, with mocking eyes, or with
      tempting eyes&mdash;the faces of men who might have been her lovers, baby
      faces of unborn children. Little hands flutter about her heart, pluck at
      her, tease her. The ghosts of her girlhood crowd about her, the ghosts of
      dead hopes, of young illusions, of romantic dreams. She thrusts them away
      from her vision. She puts her hands before her eyes, and moans a little,
      quietly, so that the servants in the kitchen shall not hear.
    </p>
    <p>
      She is assailed by strange temptations, horrible temptations, from which
      she shrinks back afraid. This hunger and thirst in her soul are so
      tormenting that she has frightful cravings for Something to satisfy her
      hunger and quench her thirst. She is tempted to take to drink, or to
      drugs, to dull the throbbing of her brain, to wake her up out of this
      awful lassitude, to give her a momentary excitement and vitality, and then&mdash;forgetfulness.
      She must have some kind of excitement&mdash;to break the awful monotony of
      her life, this intolerable dullness of her little home. If only an
      adventure would come to her! Some thrilling, perilous adventure, however
      wicked, whatever the consequences. She feels the overmastering need of
      some passionate emotion. She would like to plunge into romantic love
      again, to be set on fire by it. Somewhere about the world is a man who
      could save her, some strong man with a masterful way with him, brutal as
      well as tender, cruel as well as kind, who would come to her, and clasp
      her hands, and capture her. She would lean upon him. She would yield,
      willingly.... She tries to crush down these thoughts. She is horrified at
      the evil in them. Oh, she is a bad woman! Even in her loneliness her face
      scorches with shame. She gives a faint cry to God to save her. But again
      and again the devilish thoughts leer up in her brain. She begins to
      believe that the devil is really busy with her and that she cannot escape
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      She has a strange sense of impending peril, of something that is going to
      happen. She knows that something <i>must</i> happen.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this Eighth Year she is in a state bordering on hysteria, when anything
      may happen to her. Even her husband is beginning to get alarmed. He is at
      last awakened out of his self-complacency. He is beginning to watch her,
      with a vague uneasiness. Why does she look so queerly at him sometimes as
      though she hated him? Why does she say such bitter, cruel, satirical
      things, which stab him and leave a poison in the wound? Why does she get
      into such passionate rages about trivial things, and then reveal a
      passionate remorse? Why does she sink into long silences, sitting with her
      hands in her lap, staring at the pattern on the carpet, as though it had
      put a spell upon her? He cannot understand. She says there is nothing
      wrong with her health, she refuses to see a doctor. She scoffs at the idea
      of going away for a little holiday to the seaside. She says it would bore
      her to death. Once she bursts into tears and weeps on his shoulder. But
      she cannot, or will not, explain the cause of her tears, so that he
      becomes impatient with her and talks to her roughly, though he is sorry
      afterwards. He begins to see now that marriage is a difficult game.
      Perhaps they were not suited to each other. They married too young, before
      they had understood each other.... However they have got to make the best
      of it now. That is the law of life&mdash;to make the best of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      So in the Eighth Year the husband tries to take a common-sense view of
      things, not knowing that in the Eighth Year it is too late for common
      sense as far as the wife is concerned. She wants uncommon sense. Only some
      tremendous and extraordinary influence, spiritual, or moral, or
      intellectual, beyond the limits of ordinary common sense, may save her
      from the perils in her own heart. She must find a way of escape, for these
      unsatisfied yearnings, for this beating heart, for this throbbing brain.
      Her little home has become a cage to her. Her husband has become her
      jailer. Her life has become too narrow, too petty, too futile. In the
      Eighth Year she must find a way of escape&mdash;anyhow, anywhere. And in
      the Eighth Year the one great question is in what direction will she go?
      There are many ways of escape.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER VII
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">O</span>ne way of escape
      is through the door of the Divorce Court. Sir Francis Jeune, when he was
      President of the Divorce Court, saw before him many of these escaping
      women, and he noted down the fact about the Eighth Year; and sitting there
      with an impassive face, but watchful eyes, he saw the characters in all
      these little tragedies and came to know the type and the plot from
      constant reiteration. Sometimes the plot varied, but only in accidentals,
      never in essentials. As the story was rehearsed before him, it always
      began in the same way, with a happy year or two of marriage. Then it was
      followed by the first stress and strain. Then there came the drifting
      apart, the little naggings, the quarrels, the misunderstandings, until the
      wife&mdash;it was generally the wife&mdash;became bored, lonely,
      emotional, hysterical, and an easy victim for the first fellow with a
      roving eye, a smooth tongue, and an easy conscience. The procession still
      goes on, the long procession of women who try to escape through the
      Divorce Court door. Every year they come, and the same story is told and
      retold with sickening repetition. In most cases they are childless wives.
      That is proved, beyond dispute, by all statistics of divorce. Sometimes
      they have one or two children, but those cases are much more rare. But
      even when there are children to complicate the issues and to be the heirs
      of these tragedies, the causes behind the tragedies are the same. The
      woman has had idle hands in her lap before the Eighth Year of marriage has
      been reached. In the early years her little home was enough to satisfy her
      mind and heart, and her interests were enough to keep her busy. The coming
      of the first child, and of the second, if there is a second, was for a
      time sufficient to crowd her day with little duties and to prevent any
      restlessness or any deadly boredom. All went well while she had but one
      maidservant, and while her husband&rsquo;s feet were still on the lower rungs of
      the ladder. But the trouble began with the arrival of the extra servant
      and with the promotion of her husband. It began when gradually she handed
      over domestic duties to paid people, when she was seldom in the kitchen
      and more in the drawing-room, when the children were put under the charge
      of a nurse, and when the responsibilities of motherhood had become a
      sinecure. The fact must be faced that a child is not always a cure for the
      emptiness of a woman&rsquo;s heart, nor an absolute pledge of fidelity between
      husband and wife. These women who seek a way of escape from their little
      homes are not always brought to that position by the unfulfilled instincts
      of motherhood. For many of them have no instincts of motherhood. They feel
      no great natural desire to have a child. They even shrink from the idea of
      motherhood, and plead their lack of courage, their ill-health, their
      weakness. With their husbands they are partners in a childless scheme, or
      if they have a child&mdash;they quickly thrust it into the nursery to
      leave themselves free.
    </p>
    <p>
      But, on the other hand, it is a fact borne out by all the figures that a
      child does in the vast majority of cases bind together the husband and
      wife, as no other influence or moral restraint; and that among all the
      women who come to the Divorce Court the overwhelming majority is made up
      of childless wives.
    </p>
    <p>
      These women are not naturally vicious. They have not gone wrong because
      their principles are perverted. They are not, as a rule, intellectual
      anarchists who have come to the conclusion that the conventional moral
      code is wrong and that the laws of marriage are neither divine nor just.
      On the contrary, they are conscience-stricken, they are terrified by their
      own act. Many of them are brokenhearted and filled with shame. It is
      pitiful to hear their letters read in court, letters to their husbands
      pleading for forgiveness, asking for &ldquo;another chance,&rdquo; or trying, feebly,
      to throw the blame on the man, and to whitewash themselves as much as
      possible. To judge from their letters it would seem that they were under
      some evil spell, and that they were conscious of being dragged away from
      their duty as though Fate had clutched them by the hair, so that although
      they struggled they could not resist, and were borne helplessly along upon
      a swift tide of passion carrying them to destruction. &ldquo;I could not help
      myself&rdquo; is the burden of their cry, as though they had no free-will, and
      no strength of will. Occasionally they give tragic pictures of their idle
      lives, so lacking in interest, so barren, so boring. There is another
      phrase which crops up again and again: &ldquo;Oh, I was bored&mdash;bored&mdash;bored!&rdquo;
       It was the man that saved her from boredom who now shares the woman&rsquo;s
      guilt, and stands in the witness box in this court of honor. He came to
      her just at that moment in the Eighth Year when she was bored to death. He
      was kind, sympathetic, understanding. He brought a little color back into
      her cheeks, a little laughter into her eyes, a little sunshine into her
      life. He seemed such a boy, so youthful and high-spirited, such a contrast
      to her husband, always busy, and always worrying over his business. He
      told good stories, took her to the theatre, arranged little
      supper-parties, made a new adventure of life. He would sit chatting with
      her over the fire, when there were flickering shadows on the walls. He
      chased away the ghosts, gave her new dreams, brought new hopes.... And
      then suddenly he begins to tempt her; and she shrinks back from him, and
      is afraid. He knows she is afraid, but he tries to laugh away her fears.
      She pleads with him to go away, but there is insincerity in her voice, her
      words are faltering. She knows that if he were to go away she would be
      left more lonely than before, in intolerable loneliness till the ghosts
      would rush back at her. So he stays, and tempts her a little more.
      Gradually, little by little, he becomes her great temptation, overwhelming
      all other things in life dwarfing all other things, even her faith and
      honor. How can she resist? By what power within her can she resist?
    </p>
    <p>
      She does not resist. And yet by yielding she does not gain that happiness
      to which she stretched out her hands. She does not satisfy the great
      hunger in her heart or quench her burning thirst. She has not even killed
      the ghosts which haunt her, or healed the pin pricks of her conscience.
      Her conscience is one great bleeding wound. For this woman of the
      middle-classes is a creature of her caste Nor in most cases can she break
      the rules of her caste without frightful hurt to herself. She was brought
      up in a &ldquo;nice&rdquo; home. Her mother was a woman of old-fashioned virtues. Her
      father was a man who would have seen her dead rather than shamed. She
      received a High School education, and read Tennyson and Longfellow with
      moral notes by her class-mistress. She used to go to church, and sometimes
      goes there still, though without any fervor or strength of faith. She has
      heard the old words, &ldquo;The wages of sin is death,&rdquo; and she shrinks a little
      when she thinks of them. Above all she has been brought up on romantic
      fiction, and that is always on the side of the angels. The modern problem
      novel has arrested her intellect, has startled her, challenged her, given
      her &ldquo;notions&rdquo;; but in her heart of hearts she still believes in the
      old-fashioned code of morals, in the sweet old virtues. This sin of hers
      is a great terror to her. She is not brazen-faced. She does not justify it
      by any advanced philosophy. She is just a poor, weak, silly woman, who has
      gone to the edge of a precipice, grown giddy, and fallen off the cliff.
      She throws up her hands with a great cry. The way of escape through the
      Divorce Court door is not a way to happiness. It is a way to remorse, to
      secret agonies, to a life-long wretchedness. Her second husband, if he
      &ldquo;plays the game&rdquo; according to the rules of the world, is not to be envied.
      Between him and this woman there are old ghosts. This way of escape is
      into a haunted house.

      CHAPTER VIII
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>housands, and tens
      of thousands of women who pass through the Eighth Year, not unscathed,
      find another way out. They are finding it now through this new femininist
      movement which is linked up with the cause of Women&rsquo;s Suffrage. The Eighth
      Year produces many suffragettes, militant and otherwise. At first, in the
      first years of their married life, they scoffed at the idea of Votes for
      Women. They could not see the sense of it. They hated the vulgarities of
      the business, the shamelessness of it, the ugly squalor of these scuffles
      with the police, these fights with the crowds, these raids on the House of
      Commons. It was opposed to all their ideals of femininity and to all their
      traditions of girlhood. &ldquo;The hussies ought to be whipped,&rdquo; is the verdict
      of the young wife in the first stage of her romantic affection. But, later
      on, when romance has worn very threadbare in the little home, when reality
      is beginning to poke its head through the drawing-room windows, she finds
      herself taking an interest in this strange manifestation which seems to be
      inspired by some kind of madness. She is silent now when some new phase in
      the conflict is being discussed in her presence. She listens and ponders.
      Presently she goes out of her way to get introduced to some suffrage woman
      on the outskirts of her acquaintance. She is surprised to find her a
      wonderfully cheerful, and apparently sane, woman, very keen, very alert,
      and with a great sense of humor&mdash;utterly unlike her tired, bored and
      melancholy self. Perhaps she is quite a young woman, a bachelor girl,
      earning her own living, down in Chelsea, or as a typist secretary in the
      City. But young as she is she has dived into all sorts of queer studies&mdash;the
      relations between men and women, the divorce laws, the science of eugenics&mdash;and
      she discusses them with an amazing frankness, and in a most revolutionary
      spirit, startling, and a little appalling, at first to this wife in her
      Eighth Year. She has made up her mind conclusively on all the great
      questions of life. She pooh-poohs romantic love. &ldquo;There is too much fuss
      made about it,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;It is a mere episode, like influenza. There are
      bigger things.&rdquo; She holds herself perfectly free to choose her mate, and
      to remedy any little mistake which she may make in her choice. At present
      she prefers her independence and her own job, which she likes, thank you
      very much. She is tremendously enthusiastic about the work which women
      have got to do in the world, and there is nothing they cannot do, in her
      opinion. She claims an absolute equality with men. In fact, she is
      inclined to claim a superiority. After all, men are poor things....
      Altogether she is a most remarkable young woman, and she seems to get
      tremendous fun out of life&mdash;and this wife in her Eighth Year, without
      agreeing with her yet envies her!
    </p>
    <p>
      Or perhaps the wife meets a suffrage woman of middle-age. She, too, is a
      cheerful, keen, alert, bustling woman with cut-and-dried opinions on
      subjects about which the wife in the Eighth Year is full of doubt and
      perplexity. She has a certain hardness of character. She is intellectually
      hard, and without an atom of old-fashioned sentiment. She calls a spade a
      spade, in a rather embarrassing way, and prefers her facts to be naked.
      She is the mother of two children, whom she is bringing up on strictly
      eugenic principles, whatever those may be, and she is the wife of a
      husband whom she keeps in the background and treats as a negligible
      quantity. &ldquo;We wives, my dear,&rdquo; she says, &ldquo;have been too long kept
      prisoners in upholstered cages. It is time we broke our prison windows. I
      am breaking other people&rsquo;s windows as well. It lets in a lot of fresh
      air.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She talks a great deal about sweated labor, about the white-slave traffic,
      about women&rsquo;s work and wages. She talks still more about the treachery of
      the Government, the lies of politicians, the cowardice of men. &ldquo;Oh, we are
      going to make them sit up. We shall stop at nothing. It is a revolution.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She is amazed at the ignorance of the young wife. &ldquo;Good heavens, your
      education <i>has</i> been neglected!&rdquo; she cries. &ldquo;You are like all these
      stuffy suburban women, who are as ignorant of life as bunny-rabbits.
      Haven&rsquo;t you even read John Stuart Mill&rsquo;s <i>Subjection of Women?</i> Good
      gracious! Well, I will send you round some literature. It will open your
      eyes, my dear.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She sends round a lot of little pamphlets, full of dangerous ideas, ideas
      that sting like bees, ideas that are rather frightening to the wife in her
      Eighth Year. They refer to other books, which she gets out of the lending
      library. She reads Ibsen, and recognizes herself in many of those forlorn
      women in the plays. She reads small booklets on the Rights of Wives, on
      the Problems of Motherhood, on the Justice of the Vote. And suddenly,
      after a period of intellectual apathy, she is set on fire by all these
      burning sparks. She is caught up in a great flame of enthusiasm. It is
      like strong drink to her. It is like religious mania. She wakens out of
      her lethargy. Her feeling of boredom vanishes, gives way to a great
      excitement, a great exhilaration. She startles her husband, who thinks she
      has gone mad. She argues with him, laughs at his old-fashioned opinions,
      scoffs at him, pities him for his blindness. She goes out to suffrage
      meetings, starts to her feet one day and falters out a few excited words.
      She sits down with burning cheeks, with the sound of applause in her ears,
      like the roar of the sea. She learns to speak, to express herself
      coherently. She offers herself to &ldquo;the cause.&rdquo; She sells her trinkets and
      gives the money to the funds. She is out for any kind of adventure,
      however perilous. She is one of the Hot Young Bloods, or if she has not
      the pluck for that, or the strength, one of the intellectual firebrands
      who are really more dangerous.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is a queer business, this suffrage movement, which sets these women
      aflame. There are a few women in it who have the cold intellectual logic
      of John Stuart Mill himself. They have thought the thing out on scientific
      lines, in its economic, political, and social aspects. They want the vote
      honestly, as a weapon to give their sex greater power, greater
      independence, better conditions of life in the labor market. But the rank
      and file have no such intellectual purpose, though they make use of the
      same arguments and believe that these are the mainsprings of their
      actions. In reality they are Eighth Year women. That is to say, they seize
      upon the movement with a feverish desire to find in it some new motive in
      life, some tremendous excitement, some ideals greater and more thrilling
      than the little ideals of their home life. In this movement, in this great
      battle, they see many things which they keep secret. They go into it with
      blind impulses, which they do not understand, except vaguely. It is a
      movement of revolt against all the trammels of sex relationship which have
      come down through savagery to civilization; laws evolved out of the
      inherited experience of tribes and races for the protection of womanhood
      and the functions of womanhood, laws of repression, of restraint, for the
      sake of the children of the race; duties exacted by the social code again
      for the sake of the next generation. Having revolted against the duties of
      motherhood, all these laws, these trammels, these fetters, become to them
      intolerable, meaningless, exasperating. The scheme of monogamy breaks
      down. It has no deep moral purpose behind it, because the family is not
      complete. The scheme has been frustrated by the childlessness of the wife.
      Again, this movement is a revolt against the whole structure of modern
      society as it affects the woman&mdash;against the very architecture of the
      home; against all those tiny flats, those small suburban houses, in which
      women are cramped and confined, and cut off from the large world. It did
      not matter so long as there was a large world within the four walls. Their
      space was big enough to hold the big ideals of old-fashioned womanhood, in
      which the upbringing of children was foremost and all-absorbing. But for a
      woman who has lost these ideals and the duties that result from them,
      these little places are too narrow for their restless hearts; they become
      like prison cells, in which their spirits go pacing up and down, up and
      down, to come up against the walls, to heat their hands against them. They
      believe that they may find in this suffrage movement the key to the riddle
      of the mysteries in their souls, world-old mysteries, of yearnings for the
      Unknown Good, of cravings for the Eternal Satisfaction, for the perfect
      fulfilment of their beings. Their poor husband, a dear good fellow, after
      all, now that they look at him without hysteria, has not provided this
      Eternal Satisfaction. He has only provided pretty frocks, tickets for
      matinées, foolish little luxuries. He does not stand for them as the
      Unknown Good. After the first year or two of marriage they know him with
      all his faults and flaws, and familiarity breeds contempt. But here, in
      this struggle for the Vote, in these window-breakings and house-burnings,
      in imprisonments and forcible feedings, in this solidarity of women
      inspired by a fierce fanaticism&mdash;there is, they think, the answer to
      all their unsolved questions, the splendor and the glory of their sex, the
      possibility of magnificent promises and gifts, in which the soul of woman
      may at last find peace, and her body its liberty. She is to have the
      supreme mastery over her own spirit and flesh.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is a fine promise. But as yet it is unfulfilled. It is not to be denied
      that for a time at least some of these women do gain a cheerfulness, a
      keenness, a vitality, which seem to be a great recompense for their
      struggles and strivings. But they are the younger women, and especially
      the young unmarried women, who get a good deal of fun out of all this
      excitement, all this adventure, all the dangerous defiance of law and
      convention. The older women&mdash;many of them&mdash;are already suffering
      a sad disillusionment. They have not yet found those splendid things which
      seemed at last within their grasp. They are desperate to get them, fierce
      in their desire for them, but the cup of wine is withheld from their lips.
      They find themselves growing old and still unsatisfied, growing hard, and&rsquo; 
      bitter, and revengeful against those who thwart them. The problems of
      their sex still remain with them. They may break all the laws, but get no
      nearer to liberty. They are still prisoners of fate, bond-slaves to a
      nature which they do not understand. The femininist movement is only a
      temporary way of escape for the wife who has reached her crisis in the
      Eighth Year.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER IX
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>here is another
      way, and it has many doors. It is religion. Many of these women &ldquo;take to
      religion&rdquo; as they take to the suffrage movement, and find the same
      emotional excitement and adventure in it. They are caught up in it as by a
      burning flame. It satisfies something of their yearnings and desires. And
      it is a curious and lamentable thing that although it has been proved
      conclusively by all masters of philosophy and by all great thinkers, that
      some form of religion, is an essential need in the heart of women, the
      whole tendency of the time is to rob them of this spiritual guidance and
      comfort. Religion is not a part of the social scheme of things in
      &ldquo;intellectual mansions&rdquo; and in the small suburban houses of the
      professional classes. It is not entirely wiped off the slate, but it is
      regarded with indifference and as of no vital account in the sum of daily
      life. Occasionally a certain homage is paid to it, as to a pleasant,
      old-fashioned ritual which belongs to the code of &ldquo;good form.&rdquo; In their
      courting days the young man and woman went to church now and then on a
      Sunday morning or a Sunday evening and held the same hymn-book, and
      enjoyed a little spiritual sentiment. They were married in church to the
      music of the Wedding March played by the organist. Sometimes as the years
      pass they drop into a service where there is good singing, a popular
      preacher, and a fashionable congregation. They regard themselves as
      Christians, and condescend to acknowledge the existence of God, in a
      vague, tolerant kind of way. But they do not enter into any intimate
      relations with God. He is not down on their visiting list. Many of them do
      not even go as far as those people I have described who regard God as part
      of the social code of &ldquo;good form.&rdquo; They become frankly agnostic and smile
      at their neighbors who put on top-hats and silk dresses and stroll to
      church on a Sunday morning. It seems to them absurdly &ldquo;Early Victorian.&rdquo;
       For they have read a great number of little books by the latest writers,
      who publish their philosophy in sevenpenny editions, and they have reached
      an intellectual position when they have a smattering of knowledge on the
      subject of evolution, anthropology, the origins of religion, literature
      and dogma, and the higher criticism. They have also read extracts from the
      works of Nietzsche, Kant, and the great free-thinkers, or reviews of their
      works in the halfpenny newspapers. The ideas of the great thinkers and
      great rebels have filtered down to them through the writings of little
      thinkers and little rebels. They have been amused by the audacities of
      Bernard Shaw and other intellectuals of their own age. They have read the
      novels of H. G. Wells, which seem to put God in His right place. They have
      imbibed unconsciously the atmosphere of free-thought and religious
      indifference which comes through the open windows, through the keyholes,
      through every nook and cranny. Occasionally the husband lays down the law
      on the subject with dogmatic agnosticism, or dismisses the whole business
      of religion with a laugh as a matter of no importance either way,
      certainly as a problem not worth bothering about.
    </p>
    <p>
      So the wife&rsquo;s spiritual nature is starved. She is not even conscious of
      it, except just now and then when she is aware of a kind of spiritual
      hunger, or when she has little thoughts of terror at the idea of death, or
      when she is in low spirits. She has no firm and certain faith to which she
      can cling in moments of perplexity. She has no belief in any divine
      authority from which she can seek guidance for her actions. There is no
      supernatural influence about her from which she can draw any sweetness of
      consolation, when the drudgery and monotony of life begins to pall on her.
      When temptations come she has no anchor holding her fast to duty and
      honor. She has no tremendous ideals giving a large meaning to the little
      things of life. She has no spiritual vision to explain the mysteries of
      her own heart, or any spiritual balm to ease its pain and restlessness.
      She must rely always on her common sense, on her own experience, on her
      own poor little principles of what is right or wrong, or expedient, or
      &ldquo;the proper thing.&rdquo; When those fail her, all fails; she is helpless, like
      a ship without a rudder, like a straw in the eddy of a mill race.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is just at this time, when all has failed her, and when she seems to be
      drifting helplessly, that she is ready for religion, a bundle of dry straw
      which will burst into flame at the touch of a spark, a spiritual appetite
      hungry for food. In hundreds of cases these women take to the queerest
      kinds of spiritual food, some of it very poisonous stuff. Any impostor
      with a new creed may get hold of them. Any false prophet may dupe them
      into allegiance. They get into the hands of peculiar people. They are
      tempted to go to a spiritualistic séance and listen to the jargon of
      spiritualism. It frightens them at first, but after their first fears, and
      a little shrinking horror, they go forward into these &ldquo;mysteries,&rdquo; and are
      obsessed by them. It appears they are &ldquo;psychical.&rdquo; Undoubtedly after a
      little practice they could get into touch with the spirit-world. With
      planchette and table-rapping, and with mediumistic guidance, they may
      learn the secrets of the ghost-world, and invoke the aid of spirits in
      their little household. It becomes a mania with them. It becomes, in many
      cases, sheer madness.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are other women who seek their spiritual salvation among the
      clairvoyants and crystal-gazers and palmists of the West End.
    </p>
    <p>
      They become devotees of the Black Art, and dupes of those who prey upon
      the Eternal Gullible. There are others who join the Christian Scientists,
      and find the key to the riddle of life in the writings of Mrs. Eddy. They
      experiment in will-power&mdash;upon their unfortunate husbands. They adopt
      the simple life, and bring themselves into a low state of health by fruit
      diet. They learn a new language full of strange technical terms, which
      they but dimly understand, yet find comforting, like the old woman and her
      Mesopotamia, which was a blessèd word to her. But in spite of all its
      falsity and folly, it does give them a new interest in life, and lift them
      right out of the ruck of suburban dulness. So far at least it is helpful
      to them. It is some kind of spiritual satisfaction, though afterwards,
      perhaps, they may fall into a spiritual excitement and hysteria worse than
      their old restlessness, and become a nuisance to their family and friends,
      women with <i>idées fixes</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is better for them if they can grope their way back to the old
      Christian faith, with its sweetness and serenity and divine ideals. Here
      at last the woman may find authority, not to be argued about, not to be
      dodged, but to be obeyed. Here at last she may find tremendous ideals
      giving a significance to the little things of life, which seemed so
      trivial, so futile, and so purposeless. Here is wholesome food for her
      spiritual hunger, giving her new strength and courage, patience and
      resignation. Here are great moral lessons from which she may draw wisdom
      and guidance for her own poor perplexities. Then when temptations come,
      she may cling to an anchor of faith which will not slip in shifting sands,
      but is chained to a great rock. The wisdom of the Church, the accumulated
      experience stored up in the Church, the sweetness of all great Christian
      lives, the splendid serenity of the Christian laws, so stern and yet so
      tolerant, so hard and yet so easy, give to this woman&rsquo;s soul the peace she
      has desired, not to be found among the ghosts of modern spiritualism, nor
      in the pseudo-scientific jargon of Mrs. Eddy&rsquo;s works, nor in the
      glass-crystals of the clairvoyants. For the Christian faith has no use for
      hysteria; it exacts a healthy discipline of mind. It demands obedience to
      the laws of life, by which no woman may shirk the duties of her nature, or
      pander to her selfishness, or dodge the responsibilities of her state as a
      wife, or forget her marriage-vows and all that they involve.
    </p>
    <p>
      There would be no fatal significance about the Eighth Year if the old
      religion were still of vital influence in the home. For after all, in
      spite of all our cleverness, we have not yet discovered any new
      intellectual formula or philosophy which will force men and women to do
      those things which are unpleasant but necessary to insure the future of
      the race; to deny themselves so that the future generation may gain; to
      suffer willingly in this world for the sake of an advantage in a future
      life. If people do not believe in a future life, and in such rewards as
      are offered by the Christian dogma, they prefer to have their advantages
      here and now. But as we know, if we face the facts of life clearly, the
      advantages, here and now, are not easy to get. Life, at its best, is a
      disappointing business. There is a lot of rough with the smooth,
      especially for women, especially for those women of the middle-classes in
      small suburban homes, over-intel-lectualized, with highly strung nerves,
      in a narrow environment, without many interests, and without much work. It
      is just because many of them are entirely without religion to give some
      great purpose to their inevitable trivialities that their moral
      perspective becomes hopelessly inverted, as though they were gazing
      through the wrong end of the telescope. Having no banking account in the
      next life, they spend themselves in this life, and live &ldquo;on tick,&rdquo; as it
      were. Religion is the gospel of unselfishness. Lacking religion, they are
      utterly selfish. They do not worry about the future of the race. Why
      should they? All they are worrying about is to save themselves pain,
      expense, drudgery. Children are a great nuisance&mdash;therefore they will
      not have children. They want to put in a good time, to enjoy youth and
      beauty as long as possible, to get as much fun as they can here and now.
      But, as we have seen, the fun begins to peter out somewhere about the
      Eighth Year, and &ldquo;the good time&rdquo; has disappeared like a mirage when one
      gets close to it, and even youth and beauty are drooping and faded like
      yesterday&rsquo;s flowers. What is the woman to do then? She is the victim of
      shattered illusions, of broken hopes. Before her is nothing but a gray
      vista of years. She has nothing to reconcile her with the boredom of her
      days, nothing to compensate her for domestic drudgery, no cure for the
      restlessness and feverishness which consume her, no laws by which she may
      keep straight. She sees crookedly, her spirit rushes about hither and
      thither. She is like a hunted thing, hunted by her desires, and she can
      find no sanctuary; no sanctuary unless she finds religion, and the right
      religion. There are not many women nowadays who find this way of escape,
      for religion has gone out of fashion, like last year&rsquo;s hats, and it wants
      a lot of pluck to wear a last year&rsquo;s hat.

      CHAPTER X
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">B</span>esides, the
      husband does not like it. He discourages religion, except in homoeopathic
      doses, taken by way of a little tonic, as one goes to the theatre for a
      pick-me-up. As he remarks, he does not believe in women being too
      spiritual. It is not &ldquo;healthy.&rdquo; If his wife goes to church with any
      regularity he suspects there is an attractive cleric round the corner. And
      sometimes he is right. Anyhow, he does not feel the need of religion,
      except when he gets a pretty bad dose of influenza and has an uneasy
      thought that he is going to &ldquo;peg out.&rdquo; As a rule he enjoys good health,
      and has no time to bother about the supernatural. He does not meet it in
      the city. It is not a marketable commodity. It is not, as he says, &ldquo;in his
      line of country.&rdquo; He does not see why it should be in his wife&rsquo;s line of
      country. He is annoyed when his wife takes up any of these cranky ideas.
      He rages inwardly when she takes them up passionately. Why can&rsquo;t she be
      normal?
    </p>
    <p>
      Why on earth can&rsquo;t she go on as she began, with her little feminine
      interests, keeping herself pretty for his sake, keen on the latest
      fashions, neighborly with young wives like herself, and fond of a bit of
      frivolity now and then? When she complains that she has idle hands in her
      lap, and wants something to do, he reminds her that she found plenty to do
      in the first years of her married life. When she cries out that she is
      bored, he points out to her that she gets much more amusement than he
      does.
    </p>
    <p>
      And that is true, because by the time he has reached the Eighth Year he is
      pretty busy. Ambition has caught hold of him and he is making a career. It
      is not easy. Competition is deadly. He has got his work cut out to keep
      abreast with his competitors. It is a constant struggle &ldquo;to keep his end
      up.&rdquo; He finds it disconcerting when he comes home in the evenings after
      the anxiety of his days, dog-tired and needing sympathy, to find that his
      wife has an attack of nerves, or a feverish desire to go out and &ldquo;see
      something.&rdquo; He wants to stay at home and rest, to dawdle over the evening
      paper, to listen to a tune or two from his wife.
    </p>
    <p>
      He would like her to bring his slippers to him, as she used to do in the
      old days, to hover round him a little with endearing words, and then, with
      not too much of <i>that</i>, to keep quiet, assenting to his opinions when
      he expresses them, and being restful. He has his own grievances. He is not
      without troubles of soul and body. He has had to face disappointment,
      disillusionment, hours of blank pessimism. He has had to get to grips with
      reality, after the romanticism of his youth, and to put a check upon his
      natural instincts and desires. In many ways it is harder for the man than
      for the woman. Civilization and the monogamous code have not been framed
      on easy lines for men. To keep the ordinary rules of his caste he must put
      a continual restraint upon himself, make many sacrifices. Women and wives
      forget that human nature has not changed because men wear black coats and
      tall hats instead of the skins of beasts. Human nature is exactly the same
      as it ever was, strong and savage, but it has to be tamed and repressed
      within the four walls of a flat in West Kensington, or within a
      semi-detached house at Wimbledon.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are moments when the man hears the call of the wild, and loathes
      respectability and conventionality with a deadly loathing. In his heart,
      as in the heart of every man, there is a little Bohemia, a little country
      of lawlessness and errant fancy and primitive desires. Sometimes when he
      has shut himself up in his study, when the servants are in the kitchen
      washing up the supper-things, when his wife is lying down with a bad
      headache, he unlocks the door of that Bohemia in his heart, and his
      imagination goes roving, and he hears the pan-pipes calling, and the stamp
      of the cloven hoofs of the old Nature-god. He would like to cut and run
      sometimes from this respectable life of his, to go in search of adventure
      down forbidden pathways, and to find the joy of life again in Liberty
      Hall. This fretful wife of his, this social-ladder climbing, the whole
      business of &ldquo;playing the game&rdquo; in the same old way, makes him very tired,
      and gets on his nerves at times most damnably. He has his temptations. He
      hears siren voices calling him. He sees the lure of the witch-women. To
      feel his pulse thrill to the wine of life, to get the fever of joy in his
      blood again, to plunge into the fiery lake of passion, are temptations
      from which he does not escape because he is Something in the City, or a
      barrister-at-law, and a married man with a delicate wife. But, being a
      man, with a man&rsquo;s work, and a man&rsquo;s ambition, he keeps his sanity, and
      quite often his self-respect. His eyes are clear enough to see the
      notice-boards on the boundary lines of the forbidden territory,
      &ldquo;Trespassers will be prosecuted,&rdquo; &ldquo;Please keep off the grass,&rdquo; &ldquo;No
      thoroughfare.&rdquo; He locks up the gate to the little Bohemia in his heart,
      and puts the key into a secret cupboard of his brain. He understands quite
      clearly that if he once &ldquo;goes off the rails,&rdquo; as he calls it, his
      ambitions will be frustrated and his career spoiled. Besides, being a
      conventionalist and somewhat of a snob, he would hate to be found out in
      any violation of the social code, and his blood runs cold at the idea of
      his making a fool of himself with a woman, or anything of that kind. The
      creed of his social code, of the pot-hatted civilization, of this suburban
      conventionality of these little private snob-doms, is stronger in the man
      than in the woman. When she once takes the bit between her teeth, as it
      were, she becomes utterly lawless. But the man reins himself in more
      easily. He finds it on the whole less difficult to be law-abiding. He has
      also a clearer vision of the logic of things. He knows that certain
      results follow certain causes. He can measure up the consequences of an
      act, and weigh them. He is guided by his brain rather than by his
      emotions. He has certain fixed principles deeply rooted in him. He has a
      more delicate sense of honor than most women. It is summed up in that old
      school-phrase of his&mdash;&ldquo;playing the game.&rdquo; However much his nerves may
      be jangled, and goodness knows they are often jangled, especially as the
      Eighth Year draws near, he is generally master of himself. At least he
      does not, as a rule, have hysterical outbursts, or give rein to passionate
      impulses, or suddenly take some wild plunge, upsetting all the balance of
      his life. He does not take frightful risks, as a woman will always take
      them, recklessly, when she reaches her crisis.
    </p>
    <p>
      So it is that he looks coldly upon his wife&rsquo;s desires for some new
      emotional activity, of whatever kind it may be, religious, political, or
      ethical. He hates any symptoms of fanaticism. He shivers at any breach of
      good form. He would like her always to be sitting in the drawing-room when
      he comes home, in a pretty frock, with a novel in her lap, with a smile in
      her eyes. He does not and will not understand that this childless wife of
      his must have strong interests outside her little home to save her from
      eating her heart out. He hides from himself the fact that her
      childlessness is a curse which is blighting her. He pooh-poohs her tragic
      cry for help. He is just a little brutal with her when she accuses him of
      thwarting all the desires of her soul. And he is scared, thoroughly
      scared, when at last she takes flight, on wild wings, to some spiritual
      country, or to some moral, or immoral, territory, where he could not
      follow. He tries to call her back. But sometimes she may not be called
      back. She has escaped beyond the reach of his voice.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XI
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">S</span>nobbishness is one
      of the causes which lead to the Eighth Year, and not the least among them.
      It is an essentially middle-class snobbishness, and has grown up, like a
      fungus growth, with that immense and increasing class of small, fairly
      well-to-do households who have come into being with the advance of
      material prosperity during the past twenty-five years, and with the
      progress of elementary education, and all that it has brought with it in
      the form of new desires for pleasure, amusement and more luxuries. These
      young husbands and wives who set up their little homes are not, as I have
      said, content to start on the same level as their parents in the first
      years of their married life. They must start at least on the level of
      their parents at the end of their married life, even a little in advance.
      The seeds of snobbishness are sown before marriage. The modern son
      pooh-poohs the habits of his old-fashioned father. They are not good
      enough for him. He has at least twice the pocket-money at school compared
      with the allowance of his father when he was a boy. He goes to a more
      expensive school and learns expensive habits. When he begins work he does
      not hand over most of his salary as his father used to hand over his
      salary a generation ago, to keep the family pot boiling. He keeps all that
      he earns, though he is still living at home, and develops a nice taste in
      clothes. One tie on week-days and another tie for Sundays are still good
      enough for the father, but the son buys ties by the dozen, and then has a
      passion for fancy socks, and lets his imagination rove into all
      departments of haberdashery. He is only a middle-class young man, but he
      dresses in the style of a man of fashion, adopts some of the pleasures of
      the man about town, and is rather scornful of the little house in the
      suburbs to which he returns after a bachelor&rsquo;s dinner in a smart
      restaurant, or after a tea-party with gaiety girls. He becomes a &ldquo;Nut,&rdquo;
       and his evenings are devoted to a variety of amusements, which does away
      with a good deal of money. He smokes a special brand of cigarettes. He
      hires a motor-car occasionally for a spin down to Brighton. His mother and
      father are rather scared by this son who lives in a style utterly beyond
      their means.
    </p>
    <p>
      The girl is a feminine type of the new style. She has adopted the new
      notions. At a very early age she is expert in all the arts of the younger
      generation, and at seventeen or eighteen has already revolted from the
      authority of her parents. She is quite a nice girl, naturally, but her
      chief vice is vanity. She is eaten up with it. It is a consuming passion.
      From the moment she gets out of bed in the morning for the first glimpse
      of her face in the looking-glass to the time she goes to bed after putting
      on some lip-salve and face enamel, she is absorbed with self-consciousness
      about her &ldquo;looks.&rdquo; Her face is always occupying her attention. Even in
      railway trains she keeps biting her lips to make them red. At every window
      she passes she gives a sidelong glance to see if her face is getting on
      all right. Her main ambition in life is to be in the fashion. She is
      greedy for &ldquo;pretty things&rdquo; and sponges upon her father and mother for the
      wherewithal to buy them, and she will not lay a little finger on any work
      in the kitchen or even make a bed, lest her hands should be roughened and
      because it would not be quite &ldquo;lady-like.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A pretty education for matrimony! A nice couple to set up house together
      Poor children of life, they are doomed to have a pack of troubles. Because
      as they began they go on, with the same ideas, with the same habits of
      mind, until they get a rude shock. Their little household is a shrine to
      the great god Snob. They are his worshippers. To make a show beyond their
      meansj or up to the very limit of their means, to pretend to be better off
      than they are, to hide any sign of poverty, to dress above their rank in
      life, to show themselves in places of entertainment, to shirk domestic
      drudgery, that is their creed.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the old days, before the problem of the Eighth Year had arrived, the
      wives of men, the mothers of those very girls, kept themselves busy by
      hundreds of small duties. They made the beds, dusted the rooms, helped the
      servants in the kitchen, made a good many of their own clothes, mended
      them, altered them, cleaned the silver. But nowadays the wife of the
      professional man does none of these things if there is any escape from
      them. She keeps one servant at a time when her mother did without a
      servant. She keeps two servants as soon as her husband can afford an extra
      one, three servants if the house is large enough to hold them. Indeed, a
      rise in the social scale is immediately the excuse for an additional
      servant, and in the social status the exact financial prosperity of the
      middle-classes is reckoned by them according to the number of servants
      they keep. And whether it be two or three, the little snob wife sits in
      her drawing-room with idle hands, trying to kill time, getting tired of
      doing nothing, but proud of her laziness. And the snob husband encourages
      her in her laziness. He is proud of it, too. He would hate to think of his
      wife dusting, or cleaning, or washing up. He does not guess that this
      worship of his great god Snob is a devil&rsquo;s worship, having devilish
      results for himself and her. The idea that women want work never enters
      his head. His whole ambition in life is to prevent his wife from working,
      not only when he is alive, but after he is dead. He insures himself
      heavily and at the cost of a great financial strain upon his resources in
      order that &ldquo;if anything happens&rdquo; his wife, even then, need not raise her
      little finger to do any work. But something &ldquo;happens&rdquo; before he is dead.
      The woman revolts from the evil spell of her laziness. She finds some work
      for her idle hands to do&mdash;good work or bad.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XII
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">I</span>f only those idle
      women would find some good work to do the Eighth Year would lose its
      terrors. And there is so much good work to do if they would only lay their
      hands to it! If they cannot get in touch with God, they can at least get
      in touch with humanity. At their very doors there is a welter of
      suffering, struggling humanity craving for a little help, needing helping
      hands, on the very edge of the abyss of misery, and slipping down unless
      they get rescued in the nick of time. In the mean streets of life, in the
      hospitals, at the prison gates, in the reformatories, in the dark haunts
      of poverty, there are social workers striving and toiling and moiling in
      the service of all these seething masses of human beings. But there are
      too few of them, and the appeals for volunteers in the ranks of the unpaid
      helpers are not often answered. They are hardly ever answered from the
      class of women who have least in the world to do, and most need of such
      kinds of work. Many of these women have good voices. They sing little
      drawing-room ballads quite well, until they get sick of the sound of their
      own singing in their lonely little drawing-rooms. But they do not think of
      singing in the hospitals, and the workhouse wards, where their voices
      would give joy to suffering people, or miserable people who do not often
      hear the music of life. These women have no children. They have shirked
      the pains of childbirth. But they might help to give a little comfort and
      happiness to other mothers&rsquo; children, to shepherd a small flock for a
      day&rsquo;s outing in the country, to organize the children&rsquo;s playtime, to nurse
      the sick baby now and then. These idle women remember their own girlhood
      and its dreams. They remember their own innocence, the shelter of their
      home-life. It would be good for them if they gave a little loving service
      to the girls in the working-quarters of the great cities, and went down
      into the girl-clubs to play their dance tunes, to keep them out of the
      streets, to give them a little innocent fun in the evenings. These lazy
      women cry out that they are prisoners in upholstered cages. But there are
      many prisoners in stone cells, who at the prison gates, on their release,
      stand looking out into the cold gray world, with blank, despairing eyes,
      with no prospect but that of crime and vice, unless some unknown friend
      comes with a little warmth of human love, with a quick sympathy and a
      ready helpfulness. Here is work for workless women who are well-to-do.
      They are unhappy in their own homes, because they are tired of its
      trivialities, tired of its little luxuries, bored to death with themselves
      because they have no purpose in life. But in the mean streets round the
      corner they would find women still clinging with extraordinary courage to
      homes that have no stick of furniture in them, amazingly cheerful,
      although instead of little luxuries they have not even the barest
      necessities of life, unwearied, indefatigable, heroic in endurance, though
      they toil on sweated wages. The women of the well-to-do middle-classes
      drift apart from their husbands because perhaps they have irritable little
      habits, because they do not understand all the yearnings in their wives&rsquo; 
      hearts, because they have fallen below the old ideals of their courting
      days. But here in the slums these women with a grievance would find other
      women loyal to their husbands who come home drunk at nights, loyal through
      thick and thin to husbands who &ldquo;bash&rdquo; them when they speak a sharp word,
      loyal to the death to husbands who are untamed brutes with only the love
      of the brute for its mate. There is no problem of the Eighth Year in
      Poverty Court, only the great problems of life and death, of hunger and
      thirst and cold, of labor and want of work. Here in the mean streets of
      the world is the great lesson that want of work is the greatest disaster,
      the greatest moral tragedy, that may happen to men and women.
    </p>
    <p>
      If the idle women of the little snobdoms would come forth from their
      houses and flats, they would see that lesson staring them in the face,
      with a great warning to themselves. And if they would thrust aside their
      selfishness and learn the love of humanity, it would light a flame in
      their hearts which would kindle the dead ashes of their disillusionment
      and burn up their grievances, and make a bonfire of all their petty little
      troubles, and make such a light in their lives as would enable them to see
      the heroic qualities of ordinary duties bravely done, and of ordinary
      lives bravely led. Here they would find another way of escape from the
      perils of the Eighth Year, and a new moral health for their hearts and
      brains.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is only now and then that some woman is lucky enough to find this way
      out, for snobbishness enchains them, and it is difficult to break its
      fetters.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XIII
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">W</span>hen the woman has
      once taken flight, or is hesitating before taking her flight, in the
      Eighth Year, it is an almost hopeless business for the husband to call her
      back. Whenever she is called back, it is by some outside influence, beyond
      <i>his</i> sphere of influence, by some sudden accident, by some
      catastrophe involving both of them, or by some severe moral shock, shaking
      the foundations of their little home like an earthquake. There are cases
      in which the woman has been called back by the sudden smash-up of her
      husband&rsquo;s business, by financial ruin. In his social ladder-climbing he is
      too rash. One of the rungs of the ladder breaks beneath his feet and he
      comes toppling down. Owing to this deadly competition of modern life, he
      loses his &ldquo;job.&rdquo; It is given to a younger or better man, or to a man with
      a stronger social pull. He comes home one day with a white face,
      trembling, horribly scared, afraid to break the news to a woman who has
      not been helpful to him of late, and of whose sympathy he is no longer
      sure. He believes that this misfortune is the last straw which will break
      their strained relations. He sees the great tragedy looming ahead, hearing
      down upon him. But, curiously enough, this apparent disaster is the
      salvation of both of them. The despair of her husband calls to the woman&rsquo;s
      loyalty. All her grievances against this man are suddenly swallowed up in
      the precipice which has opened beneath his feet. All her antagonism is
      broken down and dissolved into pity. Her self-pride is slain by this man&rsquo;s
      abasement. His weakness, his need of help, his panic-stricken heart cry to
      her. After all their drifting apart, their indifference to each other,
      their independence, he wants her again. He wants her as a helpmeet. He
      wants any courage she can give him, any wisdom. And she is glad to be
      wanted. She stretches out her hands to him. They clasp each other, and
      there is no longer a gulf beneath their feet; misfortune has built a
      bridge across the gulf which divided them. More than that, all the little
      meannesses of their life, all the petty selfishness of their days, all the
      little futile things over which they have wrangled and jangled are thrust
      on one side, and are seen in their right perspective. The things that
      matter, the only things that matter, are seen, perhaps, for the first
      time, clearly, in a bright light, now that they are face to face with stem
      realities. The shock throws them off their pedestals of conceit, of
      self-consciousness, of pretence. They stand on solid ground. The shock has
      broken the masks behind which they hid themselves. It has broken the hard
      crust about their hearts. It has shattered the idol which they worshipped,
      the idol of the great god Snob.
    </p>
    <p>
      And so they stare into each other&rsquo;s soul, and take hands again like little
      children, abandoned by the Wicked Uncles of life, and they grope their way
      back to primitive things, and begin the journey again. They have found out
      that this new comradeship is better even than the old romantic love of
      their courting days. They have discovered something of the great secret of
      life. They are humbled. They make new pledges to each other, pick up the
      broken pieces of their hopes and dreams and fit them together again in a
      new and sounder scheme. This time, in some cases, they do not leave the
      baby out of the business. The wife becomes a mother, and the child chases
      away all the ghosts which haunted her in the Eighth Year. She no longer
      wants to take flight. She has been called back.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is nearly always some accident like this which calls the wife back,
      some sudden, startling change in the situation, caused by outside
      influences, or by the hand of Fate. Sometimes it is an illness which
      overtakes the husband or wife. Holding hands by the bedside, they stare
      into the face of Death, and again the trivialities of life, the pettiness
      of their previous desires, the folly of their selfishness, the stupidity
      of their little snobdom, are revealed by the whisperings of Death, and by
      its warnings. The truth of things stalks into the bedroom where the
      husband, or the wife, lies sleeping on the borderland. About the sick bed
      the weeping woman makes new vows, tears wash out her vanity, her
      self-conceit. Or, kneeling by the side of the woman whose transparent hand
      he clasps above the coverlet, the husband listens to the little voice
      within his conscience, and understands, with a great heartache, the
      pitiful meaning of the domestic strife which seemed to have killed his
      love for the woman for whose life now he makes a passionate cry. In the
      period of convalescence, after Death has stolen away, when life smiles
      again through the open windows, that man and woman get back to sanity and
      to wisdom beyond that of common-sense. They begin again with new ideals.
      Perhaps in a little while one of the rooms becomes a nursery. They get
      back to the joy of youth, once more the woman has been called back.
    </p>
    <p>
      If none of these &ldquo;accidents&rdquo; happen, if some great influence like this
      does not thrust its way into the lives of this husband and wife during the
      crisis of the Eighth Year, if the woman is not caught up by some great
      enthusiasm, or if she can find no work for the idle hands to do, giving
      her new and absorbing interests to satisfy her heart and brain, then the
      Eighth Year is a fatal year, and the President of the Divorce Court has a
      new case added to his list, or the family records of the country chronicle
      another separation, or another woman goes to prison for arson or
      bomb-throwing. Because the laws of psychology are not so erratic as the
      world imagines. They work out on definite lines. Certain psychological
      forces having been set in motion, they lead inevitably to certain results.
      When once a woman has lost her interest in her home and husband, when she
      has become bored with herself, when she has a morbid craving for
      excitement and adventures, when she has become peevish and listless and
      hungry-hearted, she cannot remain in this condition. Those forces within
      her are tremendously powerful. They must find some outlet. They must reach
      a definite time of crisis when things have got to happen. These vague
      yearnings must be satisfied, somehow, anyhow. The emptiness of her heart
      must be filled by something or other. She will search round with
      wondering, wistful eyes, more desperate day by day, until she finds the
      thing, however evil it may be, however dangerous. She must still that
      throbbing brain of hers, even if she has to take drugs to do so. In spite
      of all the poison laws, she will find some kind of poison, some subtle and
      insidious drug to give her temporary cure, a period of vitality, a thrill
      of excitement, a glittering dream or two, a relief from the dulness which
      is pressing down upon her with leaden weights. She knows the penalty which
      follows this drug-taking&mdash;the awful reaction, the deadly lethargy
      that follows, the nervous crises, the loss of will-power, but she is
      prepared to pay the price because for a little while she gets peace, and
      artificial life. The family doctors know the prevalence of those
      drug-taking habits. They know the cause of them, they have watched the
      pitiful drama of these women&rsquo;s lives. But they can do nothing to cut out
      the cause. Not even the surgeon&rsquo;s knife can do that; their warnings fall
      on deaf ears, or are answered by a hysterical laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      As I have shown, there are other forms of drug-taking not less dangerous
      in their moral effects. If the woman does not go to the chemist&rsquo;s shop,
      she goes to the darkened room of the clairvoyant and the crystal-gazer, or
      to the spiritualistic séance, or to the man who hides his time until the
      crisis of the Eighth Year delivers the woman into his hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here, then, frankly and in detail, I have set out the meaning of this
      dangerous year of married life, and have endeavored, honestly, to analyze
      all the social and psychological forces which go to make that crisis. It
      is, in some measure, a study of our modern conditions of life as they
      prevail among the middle-classes, so that the problem is not abnormal, but
      is present, to some extent, in hundreds of thousands of small households
      to-day. All the tendencies of the time, all the revolutionary ideas that
      are in the very air we breathe, all this modern spirit of revolt against
      disagreeable duties, and drudgery, and discipline, the decay of religious
      authority, the sapping of spiritual faith, the striving for social
      success, the cult of snobbishness, the new creed of selfishness which
      ignores the future of the race and demands a good time here and now, the
      lack of any ideals larger than private interests and personal comforts,
      the ignorance of men and women who call themselves intellectual, the
      nervous irritability of husbands and wives who live up to the last penny
      of their incomes, above all the childlessness of these women who live in
      small flats and suburban villas, and their utter laziness, all those signs
      and symptoms of our social sickness lead up, inevitably, and with fatal
      logic, to the tragedy of the Eighth Year.

      CHAPTER I
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">I</span>n the drawing-room
      of a flat in Intellectual Mansions, S. W., there was an air of quietude
      and peace. No one would have imagined for a moment that the atmosphere was
      charged with electricity, or that the scene was set for a drama of
      emotional interest with tragic potentialities. It seemed the
      dwelling-place of middle-class culture and well-to-do gentility.
    </p>
    <p>
      The room was furnished in the &ldquo;New Art&rdquo; style, as seen in the showrooms of
      the great stores. There were sentimental pictures on the walls framed in
      dark oak. The sofa and chairs were covered in a rather flamboyant chintz.
      Through the French windows at the back could be seen the balcony railings,
      and, beyond, a bird&rsquo;s-eye view of the park. A piano-organ in the street
      below was playing the latest ragtime melody, and there was the noise of a
      great number of whistles calling for taxis, which did not seem to come.
    </p>
    <p>
      In a stiff-backed arm-chair by the fireplace sat an elderly lady, of a
      somewhat austere appearance, who was examining through her spectacles the
      cover of a paper backed novel, depicting a voluptuous young woman;
      obviously displeasing to her sense of propriety. Mrs. Heywood&rsquo;s sense of
      propriety was somewhat acutely developed, to the annoyance, at times, of
      Mollie, the maid-servant, who was clearing away the tea-things in a bad
      temper. That is to say, she was making a great deal of unnecessary
      clatter.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Heywood ignored the clatter, and concentrated her attention on the
      cover of the paper-backed book. It seemed to distress her, and presently
      she gave expression to her distress.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear me! What an improper young woman!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mollie&rsquo;s bad temper was revealed by a sudden tightening of the lips and a
      flushed face. She bent across an &ldquo;occasional&rdquo; table and peered over the
      old lady&rsquo;s shoulder, and spoke rather impudently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Excuse me, ma&rsquo;am, but that&rsquo;s <i>my</i> novel, if you don&rsquo;t mind.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I <i>do</i> mind,&rdquo; said Mrs. Heywood. &ldquo;I was shocked to find it on the
      kitchen dresser.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Molly tossed her head, so that her white cap assumed an acute angle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was shocked to see that it had gone from the kitchen dresser.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then she lowered her voice and added in a tone of bitter grievance&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Blessed if one can call anything one&rsquo;s own in this here flat.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not fit literature for <i>any</i> young girl,&rdquo; said Mrs. Heywood
      severely. She looked again at the flaunting lady with an air of extreme
      disapproval.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Disgusting!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mollie rattled the tea-things violently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s good enough for the mistress, anyhow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Heywood was surprised.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Surely she did not lend it to you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well&mdash;not exactly,&rdquo; said Mollie, with just a trace of embarrassment.
      &ldquo;I borrowed it. It&rsquo;s written by her particular friend, Mr. Bradshaw.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Bradshaw! Surely not?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The old lady wiped her spectacles rather nervously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A very nice-spoken gentleman,&rdquo; said Mollie, &ldquo;though he does write
      novels.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Heywood looked at the author&rsquo;s name for the first time and expressed
      her astonishment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good gracious! So it is.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mollie laughed as she folded up the tea-cloth. She had gained a little
      triumph, and scored off the &ldquo;mother-in-law,&rdquo; as she called the elderly
      lady, in the kitchen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, he knows a thing or two, he does, my word!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She winked solemnly at herself in the mirror over the mantelshelf.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hold your tongue, Mollie,&rdquo; said Mrs. Heywood sharply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Servants are not supposed to have any tongues. Oh, dear no!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With this sarcastic retort Mollie proceeded to put the sugar-basin into
      the china-cupboard, but seemed to expect a counter-attack. She was not
      disappointed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mollie!&rdquo; said Mrs. Heywood severely, looking over the rims of her
      spectacles.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now what&rsquo;s wrong?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have not cleaned the silver lately.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Haven&rsquo;t I?&rdquo; said Mollie sweetly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Mrs. Heywood. &ldquo;Why not, I should like to know?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mollie&rsquo;s &ldquo;sweetness&rdquo; was suddenly embittered. She spoke with ferocity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you want to know, it&rsquo;s because I won&rsquo;t obey two mistresses at once.
      There&rsquo;s no liberty for a mortal soul in this here flat. So there!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well, Mollie,&rdquo; said Mrs. Heywood mildly. &ldquo;We will wait until your
      mistress comes home. If she has any strength of mind at all she will give
      you a month&rsquo;s notice.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mollie sniffed. The idea seemed to amuse her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The poor dear hasn&rsquo;t any strength of mind.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am surprised at you, Mollie.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s why she has gone to church again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Heywood was startled. She was so startled that she forgot her anger
      with the maid.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Again? Are you sure?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, she had a look of church in her eyes when she went out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What sort of a look?&rdquo; asked Mrs. Heywood.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A stained-glass-window look.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Heywood spoke rather to herself than to Mollie.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That makes the third time to-day,&rdquo; she said pensively.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mollie spoke mysteriously. She too had forgotten her anger and impudence.
      She dropped her voice to a confidential tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The mistress is in a bad way, to my thinking. I&rsquo;ve seen it coming on.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Seen what coming on?&rdquo; asked the elderly lady.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She sits brooding too much. Doesn&rsquo;t even pitch into me when I break
      things. That&rsquo;s a bad sign.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A bad sign?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve noticed they&rsquo;re all taken like this when they go wrong,&rdquo; said the
      girl, speaking as one who had had a long experience of human nature in
      Intellectual Mansions, S. W. But these words aroused the old lady&rsquo;s wrath.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How dare you!&rdquo; said Mrs. Heywood. &ldquo;Leave the room at once.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I must tell the truth if I died for it,&rdquo; said Mollie.
    </p>
    <p>
      The two women were silent for a moment, for just then a voice outside
      called, &ldquo;Clare! Clare!&rdquo; rather impatiently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Lord!&rdquo; said Mollie. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s the master.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Clare!&rdquo; called the voice. &ldquo;Oh, confound the thing!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose he&rsquo;s lost his stud again,&rdquo; said Mollie. &ldquo;He always does on club
      nights. I&rsquo;d best be off.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She took up the tea-tray and left the room hurriedly, just as her master
      came in. It was Mr. Herbert Heywood, generally described by his neighbors
      as being &ldquo;Something in the City&rdquo;&mdash;a man of about thirty, slight,
      clean-shaven, boyish, good-looking, with nervous movements and extreme
      irritability. He was in evening clothes with his tie undone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Plague take this tie!&rdquo; he growled, making use of one or two
      un-Parliamentary expressions. Then he saw his mother and apologized.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I beg your pardon, mother. Where&rsquo;s Clare?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Heywood answered her son gloomily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think she&rsquo;s gone to church again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Again?&rdquo; said Herbert Heywood. &ldquo;Why, dash it all&mdash;I beg your pardon,
      mother&mdash;she&rsquo;s always going to church now. What&rsquo;s the attraction?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think she must be unwell,&rdquo; said Mrs. Hey-wood. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve thought so for
      some time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, nonsense! She&rsquo;s perfectly fit.... See if you can tie this bow,
      mother.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Heywood endeavored to do so, and during the process her son showed
      great impatience and made irritable grimaces. But he returned to the
      subject of his wife.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps her nerves are a bit wrong. Women are nervy creatures.... Oh,
      hang it all, mother, don&rsquo;t strangle me!... As I tell her, what&rsquo;s the good
      of having a park at your front door&mdash;Oh, thanks, that&rsquo;s better.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He looked at himself in the glass, and dabbed his face with a
      handkerchief.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course I cut myself to-night. I always do when I go to the club.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Herbert, dear,&rdquo; said Mrs. Heywood rather nervously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&mdash;I suppose Clare is not going to bless you with a child?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>In this flat</i>!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Herbert was startled and horrified. It was a great shock to him. He gazed
      round the little drawing-room rather wildly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Lord!&rdquo; he said presently, when he had calmed down a little. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t
      suggest such a thing. Besides, she is not.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m nervous about her,&rdquo; said Mrs. Heywood.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, rats, mother! I mean, don&rsquo;t be so fanciful.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like this sudden craving for religion, Herbert. It&rsquo;s unhealthy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Devilish unhealthy,&rdquo; said Herbert.
    </p>
    <p>
      He searched about vainly for his patent boots, which were in an obvious
      position. It added to his annoyance and irritability.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why can&rsquo;t she stay at home and look after me? I can&rsquo;t find a single damn
      thing. I beg your pardon, mother.... Women&rsquo;s place is in the home.... Now
      where on earth&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He resumed his search for the very obvious patent boots and at last
      discovered them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, there they are!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He glanced at the clock, and expressed the opinion that he would be late
      for the club if he did not &ldquo;look sharp.&rdquo; Then a little tragedy happened,
      and he gave a grunt of dismay when a bootlace broke.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, my hat! Why doesn&rsquo;t Clare look after my things properly?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Heywood asked another question, ignoring the broken bootlace.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Need you go to the club to-night, Herbert?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Herbert was both astonished and annoyed at this remark.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course I must. It&rsquo;s Friday night and the one little bit of Bohemianism
      I get in the week. Why not?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; said Mrs. Heywood meekly. &ldquo;Except that I thought Clare
      is feeling rather lonely.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lonely?&rdquo; said Herbert. &ldquo;She has you, hasn&rsquo;t she?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, she has me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Heywood spoke as though that might be a doubtful consolation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Besides, what more does she want? She has her afternoon At Homes, hasn&rsquo;t
      she?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, dear,&rdquo; said Mrs. Heywood, still more doubtfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And she can always go to a matinée if she wants to, can&rsquo;t she?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, dear.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then I have taken out a subscription to Mudie&rsquo;s for her, haven&rsquo;t I?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Herbert Heywood spoke as though his wife had all the blessings of life, as
      though he had provided her with all that a woman&rsquo;s heart might desire. But
      Mrs. Heywood interrupted his catalogue of good things.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think she reads too many novels,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, they broaden her mind,&rdquo; said Herbert. &ldquo;Although, I must confess they
      bore <i>me</i> to death.... Now what have I done with my cigarette-case?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He felt all over his pockets, but could not find the desired thing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, the curse of pockets!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Some of them are very dangerous, Herbert.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What, pockets?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, novels,&rdquo; said Mrs. Heywood. &ldquo;Look at this.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She thrust under his eyes the novel with the picture of the flaming lady.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gee whizz!&rdquo; said Herbert, laughing. &ldquo;Oh, well, she&rsquo;s a married woman.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you see who the author is, Herbert?&rdquo; Herbert look, and was astonished.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gerald Bradshaw, by Jove! Does he write this sort of muck?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He has been coming here rather often lately. Especially on club-nights,
      Herbert.&rdquo; Herbert Heywood showed distinct signs of annoyance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Does he, by Jove? I don&rsquo;t like the fellow. He&rsquo;s a particularly fine
      specimen of a bad hat.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid he&rsquo;s an immoral man,&rdquo; said Mrs. Heywood.
    </p>
    <p>
      Herbert shrugged his shoulders.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Clare can take care of herself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wonder,&rdquo; said Mrs. Heywood, as though she were not at all sure. &ldquo;My
      dear, I think you ought to keep an eye on your wife just now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Herbert Heywood took his eye-glass out of a fob pocket and fumbled with
      it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Keep an eye on her, mother?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She is very queer,&rdquo; said Mrs. Heywood. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t do anything to please
      her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, there&rsquo;s nothing strange in that,&rdquo; said Herbert. Then he added
      hastily&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I mean it&rsquo;s no new symptom.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Heywood stared at her son in a peculiar, significant way.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She looks as if something is going to&mdash;happen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Herbert was really startled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Happen? How? When?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t exactly explain. She appears to be waiting for something&mdash;or
      some one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Herbert was completely mystified.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t keep her waiting this evening, did I?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t mean you, dear,&rdquo; said Mrs. Heywood.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No?&mdash;Who, then?&rdquo; asked Herbert.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Heywood replied somewhat enigmatically. She gave a deep sigh and said&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We women are queer things!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Queer isn&rsquo;t the word,&rdquo; said Herbert.
    </p>
    <p>
      He stared at the carpet in a gloomy, thoughtful way, as though the pattern
      were perplexing him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps you&rsquo;re right about the novels. They&rsquo;ve been giving her notions,
      or something.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Heywood crossed the room hurriedly and went over to a drawer in a
      cabinet, from which she pulled out a number of pamphlets.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Herbert,&rdquo; she said solemnly, &ldquo;she doesn&rsquo;t read only novels. Look here.
      Look at all these little books. She simply devours them, Herbert, and then
      hides them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Naturally, after she has devoured them,&rdquo; said Herbert irritably. &ldquo;But
      what the deuce are they?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He turned them over one by one, reading out the titles, raising his
      eyebrows, and then whistling with surprise, and finally looking quite
      panic-stricken.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Women&rsquo;s Work and Wages</i>. Oh, Lord! John Stuart Mill on <i>The
      Subjection of Women. The Ethics of Ibsen</i>. Great Scott! <i>The
      Principles of Eugenics</i>.... My hat!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quite so, Herbert,&rdquo; said Mrs. Heywood, with a kind of grim satisfaction
      in his consternation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t mind her reading improper novels,&rdquo; said Herbert, &ldquo;but I draw the
      line at this sort of stuff.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s most dangerous.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s rank poison.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s what I think,&rdquo; said Mrs. Heywood.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where did she get hold of them?&rdquo; asked Herbert.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Heywood looked at her son as though she had another startling
      announcement.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;From that woman, Miss Vernon, the artist girl who lives in the flat
      above.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What, that girl who throws orange-peel over the balcony?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, the girl who is always whistling for taxis,&rdquo; said Mrs. Heywood.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What, you mean the one who complained about my singing in the bath?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I shall never forgive her for that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Said she didn&rsquo;t mind if I sang in tune.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, the one who sells a Suffragette paper outside Victoria Station.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the sort of thing she would do,&rdquo; said Herbert, with great sarcasm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I never liked her, my dear,&rdquo; said Mrs. Heywood.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Confound her impudence! As if a British subject hasn&rsquo;t an inalienable
      right to sing in his bath! She had the cheek to say I was spoiling her
      temper for the rest of the day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Heywood laughed rather bitterly. &ldquo;She looks as if she had a temper!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Herbert gave the pamphlets an angry slap with the back of his hand and let
      them fall on the floor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you mean to say <i>she</i> has been giving Clare these pestilential
      things?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I saw her bring them here,&rdquo; said Mrs. Hey-wood.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, they shan&rsquo;t stay here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Herbert went to the fireplace and took up the tongs. Then he picked up the
      pamphlets as though they might bite and tossed them into the flames.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Beastly things! Burn, won&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He gave them a savage poke, deeper into the fire, and watched them smolder
      and then break into flame.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pestilential nonsense!... That&rsquo;s a good deed done, anyhow!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Heywood was rather scared.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am afraid Clare will be very angry.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Angry! I shall give her a piece of my mind. She had no right to conceal
      these things.&rdquo; He spoke with dignity. &ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t honorable.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Mrs. Heywood, &ldquo;but all the same, dear, I wish you hadn&rsquo;t burned
      the books.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should like to burn the authors of &lsquo;em,&rdquo; said Herbert fiercely.
      &ldquo;However, they&rsquo;ll roast sooner or later, that&rsquo;s a comfort.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You had better be careful, dear,&rdquo; said Mrs. Heywood rather nervously.
      &ldquo;Clare is in a rather dangerous frame of mind just now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Clare will have to learn obedience to her husband&rsquo;s wishes,&rdquo; said
      Herbert. &ldquo;I thought she had learned by this time. She&rsquo;s been very quiet
      lately.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Too quiet, Herbert. It&rsquo;s when we women are very quiet that we are most
      dangerous.&rdquo; Herbert was beginning to feel alarmed. He did not like all
      these hints, all these vague and mysterious suggestions.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good Lord, mother, you give me the creeps. Why don&rsquo;t you speak plainly?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Heywood was listening. She seemed to hear some sounds in the hall.
      Suddenly she retreated to her arm-chair and made a pretence of searching
      for her knitting.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hush!&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Here she comes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As she spoke the words, the door opened slowly and Clare came in. She was
      a tall, elegant woman of about thirty, with a quiet manner and melancholy
      eyes in which there was a great wistfulness. She spoke rather wearily&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not gone yet, Herbert? You&rsquo;ll be late for the club.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Herbert looked at his wife curiously, as though trying to discover some of
      those symptoms to which his mother had alluded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid that&rsquo;s your fault,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My fault?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Surely you ought to stay at home sometimes and help me to get off
      decently,&rdquo; said Herbert in an aggrieved way. &ldquo;You know perfectly well my
      tie always goes wrong.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Clare sighed; and then smiled rather miserably.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why can&rsquo;t men learn to do their own ties? We&rsquo;re living in the twentieth
      century, aren&rsquo;t we?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She took off her hat, and sat down with it in her lap.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, how my head aches to-night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where have you been?&rdquo; asked Herbert
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, dear, where <i>have</i> you been?&rdquo; asked Mrs. Heywood.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been round to church for a few minutes,&rdquo; said Clare.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What on earth for?&rdquo; asked Herbert impatiently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What does one go to church for?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;God knows!&rdquo; said Herbert bitterly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Precisely. Have you any objection?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I have.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Herbert spoke with some severity, as though he had many objections.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t object to you going to your club,&rdquo; said Clare.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, that&rsquo;s different.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In what way?&rdquo; asked Clare.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In every way. I am a man, and you&rsquo;re a woman.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Clare Heywood thought this answer out. She seemed to find something in the
      argument.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;it does make a lot of difference.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I object strongly to this religious craze of yours,&rdquo; said Herbert, trying
      to be calm and reasonable. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s unnatural. It&rsquo;s&mdash;it&rsquo;s devilish
      absurd.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It may keep me from&mdash;from doing other things,&rdquo; said Clare.
    </p>
    <p>
      She spoke as though the words had some tragic significance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why can&rsquo;t you stay at home and read a decent novel?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is so difficult to find a <i>decent</i> novel. And I am sick of them
      all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, play the piano, then,&rdquo; said Herbert.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am tired of playing the piano, especially when there is no one to
      listen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s mother,&rdquo; said Herbert.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mother has no ear for music.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Heywood was annoyed at this remark. It seemed to her unjust.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How can you say so, Clare? You know I love Mozart.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t played Mozart for years,&rdquo; said Clare, laughing a little. &ldquo;You
      are thinking of Mendelssohn.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, it&rsquo;s all the same,&rdquo; said Mrs. Heywood.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I suppose so,&rdquo; said Clare very wearily. She drooped her head and
      shut her eyes until suddenly she seemed to smell something.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is there anything burning?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Burning?&rdquo; said Herbert nervously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is a queer smell in the flat,&rdquo; said Clare.
    </p>
    <p>
      Herbert stood with his back to the fire, and sniffed strenuously. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t
      smell anything.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s your fancy, dear,&rdquo; said Mrs. Heywood.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the smell of burned paper,&rdquo; said Clare quite positively.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you think so?&rdquo; said her mother-in-law.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Burned paper?&rdquo; said Herbert.
    </p>
    <p>
      Clare became suspicious. She leaned forward in her chair and stared into
      the fireplace.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What are all those ashes in the grate?&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes,&rdquo; said Herbert, as though he had suddenly remembered. &ldquo;Of course
      I <i>have</i> been burning some papers.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What papers?&rdquo; asked Clare.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, old things,&rdquo; said Herbert rather hurriedly. &ldquo;Well, I had better be
      off. Goodnight, mother.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He kissed her affectionately and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t stay up late. I have taken the key, Clare.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope it will fit the lock when you come back,&rdquo; said Clare.
    </p>
    <p>
      She spoke the words very quietly, but for some reason they raised her
      husband&rsquo;s ire.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For heaven&rsquo;s sake don&rsquo;t try to be funny, Clare.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wasn&rsquo;t trying,&rdquo; said Clare very calmly. For a moment Herbert hesitated.
      Then he came back to his wife and kissed her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think we are both a bit irritable to-night, aren&rsquo;t we?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are we?&rdquo; said Clare.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nerves,&rdquo; said Herbert, &ldquo;the curse of the age. Well, good-night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Just as he was going out, Mollie, the maidservant, came in and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s Miss Vernon, ma&rsquo;am.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; said Clare. She glanced at her husband for a moment and theft said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, bring her in, Mollie.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; said Mollie, going out of the room again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Great Scott!&rdquo; exclaimed Herbert, in a sudden excitement. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s that woman
      who flings her beastly orange-peel into my window boxes. Clare, I strongly
      object&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Clare answered him a little passionately: &ldquo;Oh, I am tired of your
      objections.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She&rsquo;s not a respectable character,&rdquo; said Herbert.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hush, Herbert!&rdquo; said Mrs. Heywood.
    </p>
    <p>
      As she spoke the girl who had been called Madge Vernon entered the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was a bright, cheery girl, dressed plainly in a tailor-made coat and
      skirt, with brown boots.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought I would look in for half-an-hour,&rdquo; she said very cheerfully to
      Clare. &ldquo;If you are busy, send me packing, my dear.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am never busy,&rdquo; said Clare. &ldquo;I have nothing in the world to do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, that&rsquo;s rotten!&rdquo; said Madge. &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t you invent something? How are you,
      Mrs. Heywood?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She shook hands with the old lady, who answered her greeting with a rather
      grim &ldquo;Good evening.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Herbert is going out to-night,&rdquo; said Clare. &ldquo;By the way, you don&rsquo;t know
      my husband.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Madge Vernon looked at Herbert Heywood very sweetly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have heard him singing. How do you do?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Herbert was not at all pleased with her sweetness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Excuse me, won&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I am just off to my club.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you take your wife with you?&rdquo; asked Miss Vernon.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My wife! It&rsquo;s a man&rsquo;s club.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I see. Men only. Rather selfish, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Herbert Heywood was frankly astonished.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Selfish? Why selfish? Well, I won&rsquo;t stop to argue the point. Good-night,
      Clare. Doubtless you will enjoy Miss Vernon&rsquo;s remarkable and revolutionary
      ideas.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am sure I shall,&rdquo; said Clare.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Heywood followed her son to the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Be sure you put a muffler round your neck, dear.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Herbert answered his mother in a low voice, looking fiercely at Madge
      Vernon.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should like to twist it round somebody else&rsquo;s neck!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will come and find it for you, dear.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The two young women were left alone together, and Clare brought forward a
      chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sit down, won&rsquo;t you? Here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A moment later the front door was heard to hang and at the sound of it
      Madge laughed a little.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Funny things, husbands! I am sure I shouldn&rsquo;t know what to do with one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Clare smiled wanly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One can&rsquo;t do anything with them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By the by,&rdquo; said Madge, &ldquo;I have brought a new pamphlet for you. The
      &lsquo;Rights of Wives.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Clare took the small book nervously, as though it were a bomb which might
      go off at any moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have been reading those other pamphlets.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pretty good, eh?&rdquo; said Madge, laughing. &ldquo;Eye-openers! What?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They alarm me a little,&rdquo; said Clare. &ldquo;Alarm you?&rdquo; Madge Vernon was
      immensely amused. &ldquo;Why, they don&rsquo;t bite!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, they do,&rdquo; said Clare. &ldquo;Here.&rdquo; She put her hand to her head as if it
      had been wounded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You mean they give you furiously to think? Well, that&rsquo;s good.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not sure,&rdquo; said Clare. &ldquo;Since I began to think I have been very
      miserable.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, that will soon wear off,&rdquo; said Madge Vernon briskly. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll get used
      to it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It will always hurt,&rdquo; said Clare.
    </p>
    <p>
      Madge Vernon smiled at her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I made a habit of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s best not to think,&rdquo; said Clare. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s best to go on being stupid and
      self-satisfied.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Clare&rsquo;s visitor was shocked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, not self-satisfied! That is intellectual death.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There are other kinds of death,&rdquo; said Clare. &ldquo;Moral death.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Madge Vernon raised her eyebrows.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We must buck up and do things. That&rsquo;s the law of life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have nothing to do,&rdquo; said Clare, in a pitiful way.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How strange! I have such a million things to do. My days aren&rsquo;t long
      enough. I am always pottering about with one thing or another.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What kind of things?&rdquo; asked Clare wistfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      Madge Vernon gave her a cheerful little laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For one thing, it&rsquo;s a great joke having to earn one&rsquo;s own living. The
      excitement of never knowing whether one can afford the next day&rsquo;s meal!
      The joy of painting pictures&mdash;which the Royal Academy will inevitably
      reject. The horrible delight of burning them when they are rejected....
      Besides, I am a public character, I am.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you? How?&rdquo; asked Clare.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A most notorious woman. I&rsquo;m on the local Board of Guardians and all sorts
      of funny old committees for looking after everything and everybody.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you do?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Clare asked the question as though some deep mystery lay in the answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I poke up the old stick-in-the-muds,&rdquo; said Madge Vernon, &ldquo;and stir up
      no end of jolly rows. I make them do things, too; and they hate it. Oh,
      how they hate it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What things, Madge?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, attending to drains, and starving widows, and dead dogs, and
      imbecile children, and people &lsquo;what won&rsquo;t work,&rsquo; and people &lsquo;what will&rsquo; 
      but can&rsquo;t.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Clare laughed at this description and then became sad again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I envy you! I have nothing on earth to do, and my days are growing longer
      and longer, so that each one seems a year.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Haven&rsquo;t you any housework to do?&rdquo; asked Madge.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not since my husband could afford an extra servant.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Miss Vernon made an impatient little gesture.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, those extra servants! They have ruined hundreds of happy homes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, we have only got one now,&rdquo; said Clare. &ldquo;The other left last night,
      because she couldn&rsquo;t get on with my mother-in-law.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They never can!&rdquo; said Miss Vernon.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Anyhow, Herbert doesn&rsquo;t think it ladylike for me to do housework.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Madge Vernon scoffed at the idea.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ladylike! Oh, this suburban snobbishness! How I hate the damn thing!
      Forgive my bad language, won&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I like it,&rdquo; said Clare.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Vernon continued her cross-examination.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you even make your own bed? It&rsquo;s awfully healthy to turn a mattress
      and throw the pillows about.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Herbert objects to my making beds,&rdquo; said Clare.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you make the puddings or help in the washing up?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Herbert objects to my going into the kitchen,&rdquo; said Clare.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you ever break a few plates?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Clare smiled at her queer question.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, why should I?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s nothing like breaking things to relieve one&rsquo;s pent-up emotions,&rdquo;
       said Miss Vernon, with an air of profound knowledge.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The only thing I have broken lately is something&mdash;here,&rdquo; said Clare,
      putting her hand to her heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Vernon was scornful.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, rubbish! The heart is unbreakable, my dear. Now, heads are much
      easier to crack.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think mine is getting cracked, too,&rdquo; said Clare.
    </p>
    <p>
      She put her hands to her head, as though it were grievously cracked.
    </p>
    <p>
      Madge Vernon stared at her frankly and thoughtfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look here,&rdquo; she said, after a little silence, &ldquo;I tell you what <i>you</i>
      want. It&rsquo;s a baby. Why don&rsquo;t you have one?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Herbert can&rsquo;t afford it,&rdquo; said Clare. Madge Vernon raised her hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stuff and nonsense!&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Besides,&rdquo; said Clare in a matter-of-fact way, &ldquo;they don&rsquo;t make flats big
      enough for babies in Intellectual Mansions.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Madge Vernon looked round the room, and frowned angrily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, that&rsquo;s true. There&rsquo;s no place to keep a perambulator. Oh, these jerry
      builders! Immoral devils!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was a silence between the two women. Both of them seemed deep in
      thought.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then presently Clare said: &ldquo;I feel as if something were going to happen;
      as if something must happen or break.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;About time, my dear,&rdquo; said Madge. &ldquo;How long have you been married?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eight years,&rdquo; said Clare, in a casual way. Madge Vernon whistled with a
      long-drawn note of ominous meaning.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Eighth Year, eh?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, it&rsquo;s our eighth year of marriage.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s bad,&rdquo; said Madge. &ldquo;The Eighth Year! You will have to be very
      careful, Clare.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Clare was startled. &ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Haven&rsquo;t you heard?&rdquo; said Miss Vernon.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Heard what?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought everybody knew.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Knew what?&rdquo; asked Clare anxiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      Madge Vernon looked at her in a pitying way.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s in the evidence on the Royal Commission on Divorce.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;About the Eighth Year.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What about it?&rdquo; asked Clare. She was beginning to feel annoyed. What was
      Madge hiding from her?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why,&rdquo; said Madge, &ldquo;about it being the fatal year in marriage.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The fatal year?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The girl leaned forward in her chair and said in a solemn way:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There are more divorces begun in the Eighth Year than in any other
      period.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Clare Heywood was scared.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good gracious!&rdquo; she said, in a kind of whisper.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a psychological fact,&rdquo; said Madge. &ldquo;I work it out in this way. In
      the first and second years a wife is absorbed in the experiment of
      marriage and in the sentimental phase of love. In the third and fourth
      years she begins to study her husband and to find him out. In the fifth
      and sixth years, having found him out completely, she makes a working
      compromise with life and tries to make the best of it. In the seventh and
      eighth years she begins to find out herself, and then&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And then?&rdquo; asked Clare, very anxiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      Clare Heywood was profoundly disturbed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, then,&rdquo; said Madge, &ldquo;there is the devil to pay!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear God!&rdquo; she cried.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You see, it&rsquo;s like this. If a woman has no child she gets bored... . She
      can&rsquo;t help getting bored, poor soul. Her husband is so devoted to her that
      he provides her with every opportunity for getting bored&mdash;extra
      servants, extra little luxuries, and what he calls a beautiful little
      home. Ugh!&rdquo; She stared round the room and made a face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is so intent on this that he nearly works himself to death. Comes home
      with business thoughts in his head. Doesn&rsquo;t notice his wife&rsquo;s wistful
      eyes, and probably dozes off to sleep after supper. Isn&rsquo;t that so?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Clare. &ldquo;Horribly so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, then, having got bored, she gets emotional. Of course the husband
      doesn&rsquo;t notice that either. <i>He&rsquo;s</i> not emotional. He is only
      wondering how to make both ends meet. But when his wife begins to get
      emotional, when she feels that something has broken here&rdquo; (she put her
      hand to her heart), &ldquo;when she feels like crying at unexpected moments and
      laughing at the wrong time, why then&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What?&rdquo; asked Clare.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, then, it&rsquo;s about time the husband began to notice things, or things
      will begin to happen to his wife which he won&rsquo;t jolly well like. That&rsquo;s
      all!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Clare Heywood searched her friend&rsquo;s face with hungry eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, what will his wife do?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, there are various alternatives. She either takes to religion&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; said Clare, flushing a little.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Or to drink&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no!&rdquo; said Clare, shuddering a little.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Or to some other kind of man,&rdquo; said Madge very calmly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Clare Hey wood was agitated and alarmed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How do you know these things?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;ve studied &lsquo;em,&rdquo; said Madge Vernon cheerfully. &ldquo;Of course there&rsquo;s
      always another alternative.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s that?&rdquo; asked Clare eagerly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Work,&rdquo; said Madge Vernon solemnly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What kind of work?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, any kind, so long as it&rsquo;s absorbing and satisfying. Personally I like
      breaking things. One must always begin by breaking before one begins
      building. But it&rsquo;s very exciting.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It must be terribly exciting.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For instance,&rdquo; said Madge, laughing quietly, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s good to hear a pane of
      glass go crack.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How does it make you feel?&rdquo; asked Clare Heywood.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; said Madge, &ldquo;it gives one a jolly feeling down the spine. You should
      try it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I daren&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said Clare.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It would do you a lot of good. It would get rid of your megrims. Besides,
      it&rsquo;s in a good cause.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am not so sure of that,&rdquo; said Clare.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s in the cause of woman&rsquo;s liberty. It&rsquo;s in the cause of all these
      suburban wives imprisoned in these stuffy little homes. It lets in God&rsquo;s
      fresh air.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Clare rose and moved about the room. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s very stuffy in here,&rdquo; she said.
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s stifling.&rdquo; At this moment Mollie came in the room again, and smiled
      across at her mistress, saying: &ldquo;Mr. Bradshaw to see you, ma&rsquo;am.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Clare was obviously agitated. She showed signs of embarrassment, and her
      voice trembled when she said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell him&mdash;tell him I&rsquo;m engaged.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He says he must see you&mdash;on business,&rdquo; said Mollie, lingering at the
      door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On business?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s what my young man says when he whistles up the tube,&rdquo; said Mollie.
    </p>
    <p>
      Madge Vernon looked at her friend and said rather &ldquo;meaningly&rdquo;: &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you
      <i>want</i> to see him? If so I shouldn&rsquo;t if I were you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes,&rdquo; said Clare, trying to appear quite cool. &ldquo;If it&rsquo;s on business.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well, ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; said Mollie. As she left the room she said under her
      breath: &ldquo;I thought you would.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you have business relations with Mr. Bradshaw?&rdquo; asked Madge Vernon.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Clare; &ldquo;no.... In a sort of way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought he was a novelist,&rdquo; said Madge.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So he is.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dangerous fellows, novelists.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hush!&rdquo; said Clare. &ldquo;He might hear you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If it&rsquo;s on business I must go, I suppose,&rdquo; said Madge Vernon, rising from
      her chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, don&rsquo;t go; stay!&rdquo; said Clare, speaking with strange excitement.
    </p>
    <p>
      As soon as she had uttered the words the visitor, Gerald Bradshaw, came
      in.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was a handsome, &ldquo;artistic&rdquo; looking man, with longish brown hair and a
      vandyke beard. He was dressed in a brown suit, with a big brown silk tie.
      He came forward in a graceful way, perfectly at ease, and with a charming
      manner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How do you do, Mrs. Heywood?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I <i>must</i> be going,&rdquo; said Madge. &ldquo;Good-by, dear.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, <i>do</i> stay,&rdquo; whispered Clare.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Impossible. I have to speak to-night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Although Madge Vernon had ignored the artist, he smiled at her and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you speak by day as a rule?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not until I am spoken to.... Good-night, Clare.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, if you must be going&mdash;&rdquo; said Clare uneasily.
    </p>
    <p>
      Madge Vernon stood for a moment at the door and smiled back at her friend.
      &ldquo;You will remember, won&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Eighth Year,&rdquo; said Madge. With that parting shot she whisked out of
      the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gerald Bradshaw breathed a sigh of relief. Then he went across to Clare
      and kissed her hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t stand that creature. A she-devil!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She is my friend,&rdquo; said Clare.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am sorry to hear it,&rdquo; said Gerald Bradshaw.
    </p>
    <p>
      Clare Heywood drooped her eyelashes before his bold, smiling gaze.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why did you come again?&rdquo; she asked. &ldquo;I told you not to come.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is why I came. May I smoke?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He lit a cigarette before he had received he permission, and after a whiff
      or two said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is the good man at the club?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know he is at the club,&rdquo; said Clare. &ldquo;True. That is another reason
      why I came. Clare Heywood&rsquo;s face flushed and her voice trembled a little.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gerald, if you had any respect for me&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Respect is a foolish word,&rdquo; said Gerald Bradshaw. &ldquo;Hopelessly
      old-fashioned. Now adays men and women like or dislike, hate or love.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think I hate you,&rdquo; said Clare in a low voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gerald smiled at her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, you don&rsquo;t. You are a little frightened of me. That is all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The woman laughed nervously, but there was a look of fear in her eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why should I be frightened of you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because I tell you the truth. I don&rsquo;t keep up the foolish old pretences
      by which men and women hide themselves from each other. You cannot hide
      from me, Clare.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You seem to strip my soul bare,&rdquo; said Clare and when the man laughed at
      her she said: &ldquo;Yes, I am frightened of you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is because you are like all suburban women,&rdquo; said Gerald, &ldquo;brought up
      in this environment of hypocritical virtue and false sentiment. You are
      frightened at the verities of life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Clare Heywood gave a deep, quivering sigh. &ldquo;Life is a tragic thing,
      Gerald,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Life is a jolly thing if one makes the best of it, if
      one fulfils one&rsquo;s own nature.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One&rsquo;s own nature is generally bad.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never mind,&rdquo; said Gerald cheerfully. &ldquo;It is one&rsquo;s own. Bad or good, it
      must find expression instead of being smothered or strangled. Life is
      tragic only to those who are afraid of it. Don&rsquo;t be afraid, Clare. Do the
      things you want to do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is nothing I want to do,&rdquo; said Clare wearily. &ldquo;Nothing except to
      find peace.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Exactly. Peace. How can you find peace, my poor Clare, in this stuffy
      life of yours&mdash;in this daily denial of your own nature? There are
      heaps of things you want.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Clare laughed again, in a mirthless way. &ldquo;How do you know?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course I know. Shall I tell you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think I would rather you didn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said Clare.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will tell you,&rdquo; said the man. &ldquo;Liberty is one of them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Liberty is a vague word.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Liberty for your soul,&rdquo; said Gerald.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Herbert objects to my having a soul.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Liberty for that beating heart of yours, Clare.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The woman put both hands to her heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, it beats, and beats.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You want to escape, Clare.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Escape?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She seemed frightened at that word. She whispered it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Escape from the deadening influence of domestic dulness.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t deny the dulness,&rdquo; said Clare.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You want adventure. Your heart is seeking adventure. You know it. You
      know that I am telling you the truth.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As the man spoke he came closer to her, and with his hands in his pockets
      stood in front of her, staring into her eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You make me afraid,&rdquo; said Clare. All the color had faded out of her face
      and she was dead white.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You need not be afraid, Clare. The love of a man for a woman is not a
      terrifying thing. It is a good thing. Good as life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He took her by the wrists and held them tight.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gerald!&rdquo; said Clare. &ldquo;For God&rsquo;s sake.... I have a husband.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He bores you,&rdquo; said the man. &ldquo;He is your husband but not your mate. No
      woman finds peace until she finds her mate. It is the same with a man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will not listen to you. You make me feel a bad woman!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She wrenched her hands free and moved toward the bell.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gerald Bradshaw laughed quietly. He seemed amused at this woman&rsquo;s fear. He
      seemed masterful, sure of his power over her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know that you must be my mate. If not to-day, to-morrow. If not
      to-morrow, the next day. I will wait for you, Clare.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Clare had shrunk back to the wall now, and touched the electric bell.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have no pity for me,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;You play on my weakness.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fear makes you strong to resist,&rdquo; said the man. &ldquo;But love is stronger
      than fear.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He followed her across the room to where she stood crouching against the
      wall like a hunted thing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t come so close to me,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What on earth have you rung the bell for?&rdquo; asked the man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because I ought not to be alone with you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They stood looking into each other&rsquo;s eyes. Then Clare moved quickly toward
      the sofa as Mollie came in.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Mollie,&rdquo; said Clare, trying to steady her voice, &ldquo;ask Mrs. Heywood to
      come in, will you? Tell her Mr. Bradshaw is here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; said Mollie. &ldquo;But she knows that already.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take my message, please,&rdquo; said her mistress.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was going to, ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; said Mollie, and she added in an undertone, as
      she left the room, &ldquo;Strange as it may appear.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Gerald laughed quite light-heartedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, you have won the trick this time. But I hold the trump cards, Clare;
      and I am very lucky, as a rule. I have a gambler&rsquo;s luck. Of course if the
      old lady comes in I shan&rsquo;t stay. She hates me like poison, and I can&rsquo;t be
      polite to her. Insincerity is not one of my vices. Good-night, dear heart.
      I will come to you in your dreams.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As he spoke this word, which brought a flush again to Clare Heywood&rsquo;s
      face, Mrs. Hey-wood, her mother-in-law, came in. She glanced from one to
      the other suspiciously.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gerald Bradshaw was not in the least abashed by her stern face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How do you do, Mrs. Heywood? I was just going. I hope I have not
      disturbed you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Heywood answered him in a &ldquo;distant&rdquo; manner:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not in the least.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am glad,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I will let myself out. Don&rsquo;t trouble.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At that moment there was a noise in the hall, and Clare raised her head
      and listened.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think I hear another visitor,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In that ease I had better wait a moment,&rdquo; said Gerald. &ldquo;The halls of
      these flats are not cut out for two people at a time. I will light another
      cigarette if I may.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought I heard a latchkey,&rdquo; said Mrs. Heywood. &ldquo;Surely it can&rsquo;t he
      Herbert back so early?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, it can&rsquo;t be,&rdquo; said Clare.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gerald spoke more to himself than to the ladies:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope not.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They were all silent when Herbert Heywood came in quietly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t go to the club after all,&rdquo; he said. Then he saw Gerald Bradshaw,
      and his mouth hardened a little as he said, &ldquo;Oh!... How do?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How are you?&rdquo; asked Gerald, in his cool way.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Been here long?&rdquo; asked Herbert.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Long enough for a pleasant talk with your wife.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Going now?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. We have finished our chat. Goodnight. I can find my way out
      blindfolded. All these flats are the same. Rather convenient, don&rsquo;t you
      think?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He turned to Clare and smiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Au revoir</i>, Mrs. Heywood.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She did not answer him, and he went out jauntily. A few moments later they
      heard the front door shut.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What the devil does he come here for?&rdquo; growled Herbert rather sulkily.
    </p>
    <p>
      Clare ignored the question.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why are you home so early?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, dear, why didn&rsquo;t you go to the club?&rdquo; asked Mrs. Heywood.
    </p>
    <p>
      Herbert looked rather embarrassed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t know. I felt a bit off. Besides&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What, dear?&rdquo; asked his mother.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought Clare was feeling a bit lonely to-night. Perhaps I was
      mistaken.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am often lonely,&rdquo; said Clare. &ldquo;Even when you are at home.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t you <i>glad</i> I have come back?&rdquo; asked Herbert.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why do you ask me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should be glad if you were glad.&rdquo; Clare&rsquo;s husband became slightly
      sentimental as he looked at her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have been thinking it <i>is</i> rather rotten to go <i>off</i> to the
      club and leave you here alone,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Heywood was delighted with these words.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, you dear boy! How unselfish of you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I try to be,&rdquo; said Herbert.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am sure you are the very soul of unselfishness, Herbert, dear,&rdquo; said
      the fond mother.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thanks, mother.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He looked rather anxiously at Clare, and said&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you think we might have a pleasant evening for once?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, that would be delightful!&rdquo; said Mrs. Heywood.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eh, Clare?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How do you mean?&rdquo; said Clare.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Like we used to in the old days? Some music, and that sort of thing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am sure that will be <i>very</i> nice,&rdquo; said Mrs. Heywood.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eh, Clare?&rdquo; said Herbert.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you like,&rdquo; said Clare.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wait till I have got my boots off.&rdquo; He spoke in a rather honeyed voice to
      his wife.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you happen to know where my slippers are, darling?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t the least idea,&rdquo; said Clare.
    </p>
    <p>
      Herbert seemed nettled at this answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In the old days you used to warm them for me,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did I?&rdquo; said Clare. &ldquo;I have forgotten. It was a long time ago.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eight years.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At these words Clare looked over to her husband in a peculiar way.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;It is our eighth year.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here are your slippers, dear,&rdquo; said Mrs. Hey wood.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, thanks, mother. <i>You</i> don&rsquo;t forget.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was silence while he took off his boots. Clare sat with her hands in
      her lap, staring at the carpet. Once or twice her mother-in-law glanced at
      her anxiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Won&rsquo;t you play something, Clare?&rdquo; said the old lady, after a little
      while.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you like,&rdquo; said Clare.
    </p>
    <p>
      Herbert resumed his cheerful note.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, let&rsquo;s have a jolly evening. Perhaps I will sing a song presently.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, do, dear!&rdquo; said Mrs. Heywood.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gad, it&rsquo;s a long time since I sang &lsquo;John Peel&rsquo;!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Clare looked rather anxious and perturbed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The walls of this flat are rather thin,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;The neighbors might
      not like it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, confound the neighbors!&rdquo; said Herbert.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will do some knitting while you two dears play and sing,&rdquo; said the old
      lady.
    </p>
    <p>
      She fetched her knitting from a black silk bag on one of the little
      tables, and took a chair near the fireplace. Clare Heywood went to the
      music-stool and turned over some music listlessly. She did not seem to
      find anything which appealed to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her husband settled himself down in an arm-chair and loaded his pipe.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Play something bright, Clare,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All my music sounds melancholy when I play it,&rdquo; said Clare.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What, rag-time?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Even rag-time. Rag-time worst of all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Yet she began to play softly one of Chopin&rsquo;s preludes, in a dreamy way.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell me when you want me to sing,&rdquo; said Herbert.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will,&rdquo; said Clare.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was silence for a little while, except for Clare&rsquo;s dream-music. Mrs.
      Heywood dozed over her knitting, and her head nodded on her chest.
      Presently Herbert rose from his chair and touched the electric bell. A
      moment later Mollie came in.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes?&rdquo; asked Mollie.
    </p>
    <p>
      Herbert spoke quietly so that he should not interrupt his wife&rsquo;s music.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bring me <i>The Financial Times</i>, Mollie. It&rsquo;s in my study.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir,&rdquo; said Mollie.
    </p>
    <p>
      She brought the paper and left the room again. There was another silence,
      except for the soft notes of the music. Herbert turned over the pages of
      <i>The Financial Times</i>, and yawned a little, and then let the paper
      drop. His head nodded and then lolled sideways. In a little while he was
      as fast asleep as his mother, and snored, quietly at first, then quite
      loudly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Clare stopped playing, and looked over the music-rest with a strange,
      tragic smile at her husband and her mother-in-law. She rose from the
      piano-stool, and put her hands to her head, and then at her throat,
      breathing quickly and jerkily, as though she were being stifled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A jolly evening!&rdquo; she exclaimed in a whisper. &ldquo;Oh, God!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She stared round the room, with rather wild eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is stuffy here. It is stifling.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She moved toward the piano again, with her hands pressed against her
      bosom.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I feel that something <i>must</i> happen. Something <i>must</i> break.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She took up a large china vase from the piano, moved slowly toward the
      window, hesitated for a moment, looked round at her sleeping husband, and
      then hurled the vase straight through the window. It made an appalling
      noise of breaking glass.
    </p>
    <p>
      Herbert Heywood jumped up from his seat as though he had been shot.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good God!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;What the devil!&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Heywood was equally startled. She sat up in her chair as though an
      earthquake had shaken the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good gracious! Whatever in the world&mdash;&mdash;-&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At the same moment Mollie opened the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good &lsquo;eavins, ma&rsquo;am!&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;Whatever &lsquo;as &lsquo;appened?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Clare Heywood answered very quietly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think something must have broken,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then she gave a queer, strident laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br />

    <h2>
      CHAPTER II
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">M</span>RS. Heywood was
      arranging the drawingroom for an evening At Home, dusting the mantelshelf
      and some of the ornaments with a little hand broom. There were
      refreshments on a side table. Mollie was trying to make the fire burn up.
      Every now and then a gust of smoke blew down the chimney. Clare was
      sitting listlessly in a low chair near the French window, with a book on
      her lap, but she was not reading.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Drat the fire,&rdquo; said Mollie, with her head in the fireplace.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For goodness&rsquo; sake, Mollie, stop it smoking like that!&rdquo; said Mrs.
      Heywood. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s no use my dusting the room.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The devil is in the chimney, it strikes me,&rdquo; said Mollie.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Heywood expressed her sense of exasperation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a funny thing that every time your mistress gives an At Home you are
      always behindhand with your work.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mollie expressed her feelings in the firegrate.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a funny thing people can&rsquo;t mind their own business.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What did you say, Mollie?&rdquo; asked Mrs. Heywood sharply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I said that the fire hasn&rsquo;t gone right since the window was broke. Them
      Suffragettes have a lot to answer for.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I cannot understand how it <i>did</i> get broken,&rdquo; said Mrs. Heywood. &ldquo;I
      almost suspect that woman, Miss Vernon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Clare looked up and spoke irritably.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nonsense, mother!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s no use saying nonsense, Clare,&rdquo; said Mrs. Heywood, even more
      irritably. &ldquo;You know perfectly well that Miss Vernon is a most dangerous
      woman.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, she didn&rsquo;t break our window, anyhow,&rdquo; said Clare, rather doggedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How do you know that? It is still a perfect mystery.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be absurd, mother. How did the vase get through the window?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Heywood was baffled for an answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, that is most perplexing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, leave it at that,&rdquo; said Clare.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mollie was still wrestling with the mysteries of light and heat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If it doesn&rsquo;t burn now,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t lay another finger on it&mdash;At
      Home or no At Home.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She seized the dustpan and broom and, with a hot face, marched out of the
      room.
    </p>
    <p>
      Clare pressed her forehead with the tips of her fingers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish to Heaven there were no such things as At Homes,&rdquo; she said
      wearily. &ldquo;Oh, how they bore me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You used to like them well enough,&rdquo; said Mrs. Heywood.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have grown out of them. I have grown out of so many things. It is as if
      my life had shrunk in the wash.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing seems to please you now,&rdquo; said the old lady. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you care for
      your friends any longer?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Friends? Those tittle-tattling women, with their empty-headed husbands?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Heywood was silent for a moment. Then she spoke bitterly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you think Herbert is empty-headed?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, we won&rsquo;t get personal, mother,&rdquo; said Clare. &ldquo;And we won&rsquo;t quarrel, if
      you don&rsquo;t mind.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Heywood&rsquo;s lips tightened.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am afraid we shall if you go on like this.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Like what?&rdquo; asked Clare.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hush!&rdquo; said the old lady. &ldquo;Here comes Herbert.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Herbert came in quickly, and raised his eyebrows after a glance at his
      wife.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good Lord, Clare! Aren&rsquo;t you dressed yet?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s plenty of time, isn&rsquo;t there?&rdquo; said Clare.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, there isn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said Herbert. &ldquo;You know some of the guests will arrive
      before eight o&rsquo;clock.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Clare looked up at the clock.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s only six now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Besides,&rdquo; said Herbert, &ldquo;I want you to look your best to-night. Edward
      Hargreaves is coming, with his wife.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What has that got to do with it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Everything,&rdquo; said Herbert. &ldquo;He is second cousin to one of my directors.
      It is essential that you should make a good impression.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You told me once that he was a complete ass,&rdquo; said Clare.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So he is.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, then,&rdquo; said Clare, quietly but firmly, &ldquo;I decline to make a good
      impression on him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I must ask you to obey my wishes,&rdquo; said Herbert.
    </p>
    <p>
      Clare had rebellion in her eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have obeyed you for seven years. It is now the Eighth Year.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Herbert did not hear his wife&rsquo;s remark. He was looking round the room with
      an air of extreme annoyance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m blowed!&rdquo; he exclaimed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter, dear?&rdquo; asked Mrs. Hey-wood anxiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You haven&rsquo;t even taken the trouble to buy some flowers,&rdquo; said Herbert.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I left that to Clare,&rdquo; said the old lady.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Haven&rsquo;t you done so, Clare?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Clare. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t bear flowers in this room. They droop so
      quickly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Herbert was quite angry.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I insist upon having some flowers. The place looks like a barn without
      them. What will our visitors say?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stupid things, as usual,&rdquo; said Clare quietly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I must go out and get some myself, I suppose,&rdquo; said Herbert, with the air
      of a martyr.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t you send Mollie, dear?&rdquo; asked Mrs. Heywood.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mollie is cutting sandwiches. The girl is overwhelmed with work. And&mdash;Oh,
      my stars!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His mother was alarmed by this sudden cry of dismay.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now what is the matter, dear?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s no whisky in the decanter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No whisky?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Clare,&rdquo; said Herbert, appealing to his wife, &ldquo;there&rsquo;s not a drop of
      whisky left.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, <i>I</i> didn&rsquo;t drink it,&rdquo; said Clare. &ldquo;You finished it the other
      night with one of your club friends.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So we did. Dash it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be irritable, dear,&rdquo; said Mrs. Heywood.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Irritable! Isn&rsquo;t it enough to make a saint irritable? These things always
      happen on our At Home nights. Nobody seems to have any forethought. Every
      blessed thing seems to go wrong.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is why I wish one could abolish the institution,&rdquo; said Clare.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What institution?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At Homes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t talk rubbish, Clare,&rdquo; said Herbert angrily; &ldquo;you know I have them
      for <i>your</i> sake.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Clare laughed bitterly, as though she had heard a rather painful joke.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For my sake! Oh, that is good!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Herbert was distracted by a new cause of grievance as a tremendous puff of
      smoke came out of the fire-grate.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What in the name of a thousand devils&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s that awful fire again!&rdquo; cried Mrs. Hey-wood. &ldquo;These flats seem to
      have no chimneys.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s nothing to do with the flat,&rdquo; said Herbert. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s that fool Mollie.
      The girl doesn&rsquo;t know how to light a decent fire!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He rang the bell furiously, keeping his finger on the electric knob.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The creature has absolutely nothing to do, and what she does she spoils.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mollie came in with a look of mutiny on her face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look at that fire,&rdquo; said Herbert fiercely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am looking at it,&rdquo; said Mollie.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you do your work properly? See to the beastly thing, can&rsquo;t
      you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mollie folded her arms and spoke firmly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you please, sir, wild horses won&rsquo;t make me touch it again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not a question of horse-power,&rdquo; said Herbert. &ldquo;Go and get an old
      newspaper and hold it in front of the bars.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am just in the middle of the sandwiches,&rdquo; said Mollie.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, get out of them, then,&rdquo; said Herbert.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mollie delivered her usual ultimatum.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you please, sir, I beg to give a month&rsquo;s notice.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bosh!&rdquo; said Herbert.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bosh indeed!&rdquo; cried Mollie. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll see if it&rsquo;s bosh! If you want any
      sandwiches for your precious visitors you can cut &lsquo;em yourself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With this challenge she went out of the room and slammed the door behind
      her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Herbert breathed deeply, and after a moment&rsquo;s struggle in his soul spoke
      mildly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mother, go and pacify the fool, will you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She is very obstinate,&rdquo; said Mrs. Heywood.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All women are obstinate.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly the man&rsquo;s self-restraint broke down and he became excited.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bribe her, promise her a rise in wages, but for God&rsquo;s sake see that she
      cuts the sandwiches. We don&rsquo;t want to be made fools of before our guests.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well, dear,&rdquo; said Mrs. Heywood. She hesitated for a moment at the
      door, and before going out said: &ldquo;But Mollie can be very violent at
      times.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      For a little while there was silence between the husband and wife. Then
      Herbert spoke rather sternly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Clare, are you or are you not going to get dressed?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall get dressed in good time,&rdquo; said Clare quietly, &ldquo;when I think fit.
      Surely you don&rsquo;t want to dictate to me about <i>that?</i>&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Surely,&rdquo; said Herbert, &ldquo;you can see how awkward it will be if any of our
      people arrive and find you unprepared for them?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Clare gave a long, weary sigh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I <i>am</i> prepared for them. I have been trying to prepare myself
      all day for the ordeal of, them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The ordeal? What the dickens do you mean?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am prepared for Mrs. Atkinson Brown, who, when she takes off her hat in
      the bedroom, will ask me whether I am suited and whether I am expecting.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For goodness&rsquo; sake don&rsquo;t be coarse, Clare,&rdquo; said Herbert.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s Mrs. Atkinson Brown who is coarse,&rdquo; said Clare. &ldquo;And I am prepared
      for Mr. Atkinson Brown, who will say that it is horrible weather for this
      time of year, and that business has been the very devil since there has
      been a Radical Government, and that these outrageous women who are
      breaking windows ought to be whipped. Oh, I could tell you everything that
      everybody is going to say. I have heard it over and over again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It does not seem to make much effect on you,&rdquo; said Herbert. &ldquo;Especially
      that part about breaking windows.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Clare smiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So you have guessed, have you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I knew at once by the look on your face.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought you agreed with your mother that some Suffragette must have
      flung a stone from the outside.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hid the truth from mother,&rdquo; said Herbert. &ldquo;She would think you were
      mad. What on earth made you do it? <i>Were</i> you mad or what?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Clare brushed her hair back from her forehead.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sometimes I used to think I was going a little mad. But now I know what
      is the matter with me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Herbert spoke more tenderly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What <i>is</i> the matter, Clare? If it is a question of a doctor&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the Eighth Year,&rdquo; said Clare.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Eighth Year?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, that&rsquo;s what is the matter with me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What on earth do you mean?&rdquo; asked Herbert.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, don&rsquo;t you know? It was Madge Vernon who told me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Told you what?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She seemed to think that everybody knew.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Knew what?&rdquo; asked Herbert, exasperated beyond all patience.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;About the Eighth Year.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What about it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s well known, she says, that the Eighth Year is the most dangerous one
      in marriage. It is then that the pull comes, when the wife has found out
      her husband.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Found out her husband?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And found out herself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Herbert spoke roughly. He was not in a mood for such mysteries.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look here,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t listen to all this nonsense. Go and dress
      yourself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I want to talk to you, Herbert,&rdquo; said Clare very earnestly. &ldquo;I must talk
      to you before it&rsquo;s too late.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s too late now,&rdquo; said Herbert. &ldquo;Halfpast six. I must fetch that whisky
      and buy a few flowers. I shall have to put on my boots again and splash
      about in the mud in these trousers. Confound it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Before you go you must listen, Herbert,&rdquo; said Clare, with a sign of
      emotion. &ldquo;Perhaps you won&rsquo;t have another chance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank Heaven for that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When I broke that window something else broke.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One of my best vases,&rdquo; said Herbert with sarcasm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think something in my own nature broke too. My spirit has broken out of
      this narrow, deadening little life of ours, out of the smug snobbishness
      and stupidity which for so long kept me prisoner, out of the belief that
      the latest sentimental novel, the latest romantic play, the latest bit of
      tittle-tattle from my neighbors might satisfy my heart and brain. When I
      broke that window I let a little fresh air into the stifling atmosphere of
      this flat, where I have been mewed up without work, without any kind of
      honest interest, without any kind of food for my brain or soul.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Herbert stared at his wife, and made an impatient gesture.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you want work, why don&rsquo;t you attend to your domestic duties?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have no domestic duties,&rdquo; said Clare. &ldquo;That is the trouble.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Herbert laughed in an unpleasant way.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, you haven&rsquo;t even bought any flowers to decorate your home! Isn&rsquo;t
      that a domestic duty?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Clare answered him quickly, excitedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s just a part of the same old hypocrisy of keeping up appearances. You
      know you don&rsquo;t care for flowers in themselves, except as they help to make
      a show. You want to impress our guests. You want to keep up the old
      illusion of the woman&rsquo;s hand in the home. The woman&rsquo;s touch. Isn&rsquo;t that
      it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I do want to keep up that illusion,&rdquo; said Herbert; &ldquo;and by God, I
      find it very hard! You say you want an object in life. Isn&rsquo;t your husband
      an object?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Clare looked at him with a queer, pitiful smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, he is,&rdquo; she said slowly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, what more do you want?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lots more. A woman&rsquo;s life is not centered for ever in one man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It ought to be,&rdquo; said Herbert. &ldquo;If you had any religious principles&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; said Clare sharply, &ldquo;but you object to my religion!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, of course I mean in moderation.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have starved me, Herbert, and oh, I am so hungry!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Herbert answered her airily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, there will be light refreshments later.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, that is worthy of you,&rdquo; cried Clare. &ldquo;That is your sense of humor!
      You have starved my soul and starved my heart and you offer me&mdash;sandwiches.
      I am hungry for life and you offer me&mdash;the latest novel.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Herbert paced up and down the room. He was losing control of his temper.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is the reward for all my devotion!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t I drudge in the
      city every day to keep you in comfort?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want comfort!&rdquo; said Clare.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t I toil so that you may have pretty frocks?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want pretty frocks.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t I scrape and scheme to buy you little luxuries?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want little luxuries,&rdquo; said Clare.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is there anything within my means that you haven&rsquo;t got?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Clare looked at him in a peculiar way, and answered quietly&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t a child,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Lord,&rdquo; said Herbert uneasily. &ldquo;Whose fault is that? Besides, modern
      life in small flats is not cut out for children.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And modern life in small flats,&rdquo; said Clare, &ldquo;is not cut out for wives.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t my fault,&rdquo; said Herbert. &ldquo;I am not the architect&mdash;either of
      fate or flats.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, it isn&rsquo;t your fault, Herbert. You can&rsquo;t help your character. It isn&rsquo;t
      your fault that when you come home from the city you fall asleep after
      dinner. It isn&rsquo;t your fault that when you go to the club I sit at home
      with my hands in my lap, thinking and brooding. It isn&rsquo;t your fault that
      your mother and I get on each other&rsquo;s nerves. It isn&rsquo;t your fault that you
      and I have grown out of each other, that we bore each other and have
      nothing to say to each other&mdash;except when we quarrel.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, then,&rdquo; said Herbert, &ldquo;whose fault is it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; said Clare. &ldquo;I suppose it&rsquo;s a fault of the system, which
      is spoiling thousands of marriages just like ours. It&rsquo;s the fault which is
      found out&mdash;in the Eighth Year.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, curse the Eighth Year,&rdquo; said Herbert violently. &ldquo;What is that bee you
      have got in your bonnet?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a bee which keeps buzzing in my brain. It&rsquo;s a little bee which
      whispers queer words to me&mdash;tempting words. It says you must break
      away from the system or the system will break you. You must find a way of
      escape or die. You must do it quickly, now, to-night, or it will be too
      late. Herbert, a hungry woman will do desperate things to satisfy her
      appetite, and I am hungry for some stronger emotion than I can find within
      these four walls. I am hungry for love, hungry for work, hungry for life.
      If you can&rsquo;t give it to me, I must find it elsewhere.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Clare,&rdquo; said Herbert, with deliberate self-restraint, &ldquo;I must again
      remind you that time is getting on and you are not yet dressed. In a
      little while our guests will be here. I hope you don&rsquo;t mean to hold me up
      to the contempt of my friends. I at least have some sense of duty.... I am
      going to fetch the whisky.&rdquo; As he strode toward the door he started back
      at the noise of breaking china.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s that?&rdquo; asked Clare.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;God knows,&rdquo; said Herbert. &ldquo;I expect mother has broken a window.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The words were hardly out of his mouth before Mrs. Heywood came in in a
      state of great agitation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Herbert, I must really ask you to come into the kitchen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter now?&rdquo; asked Herbert, prepared for the worst.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mollie has deliberately broken our best coffee-pot.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Herbert stared at his wife.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t I tell you so!&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why has she broken the coffee-pot?&rdquo; asked Clare.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She was most insolent,&rdquo; said Mrs. Heywood, &ldquo;and said my interference got
      on her nerves.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, even a servant <i>has</i> nerves,&rdquo; said Clare.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But it was the <i>best</i> coffee-pot, Clare. Surely you are not going to
      take it so calmly?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Like mistress like maid!&rdquo; said Herbert. &ldquo;Oh, my hat! Why on earth did I
      marry?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you think you had better fetch the whisky?&rdquo; said Clare gently.
    </p>
    <p>
      Herbert became excited again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have been trying to fetch the whisky for the last half hour. There is a
      conspiracy against it. Confound it, I <i>will</i> fetch the whisky.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He strode to the door, as though he would get the whisky or die in the
      attempt.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think you ought to speak to Mollie first,&rdquo; said Mrs. Heywood.
    </p>
    <p>
      Herbert raised his hands above his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Damn Mollie!&rdquo; he shouted wildly. Then he strode out of the room. &ldquo;Damn
      everything!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor dear,&rdquo; said Mrs. Heywood. &ldquo;I wish he didn&rsquo;t get so worried.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Clare, won&rsquo;t you come and speak to Mollie?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Haven&rsquo;t you spoken to her?&rdquo; asked Clare wearily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am always speaking to her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Poor</i> Mollie!&rdquo; said Clare.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Heywood was hurt at the tone of pity. She flushed a little and then
      turned to her daughter-in-law with reproachful eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am an old woman, Clare, and the mother of your husband. Because my
      position forces me to live in this flat, I do not think you ought to
      insult me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry,&rdquo; said Clare with sincerity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mollie is right. We all get on each other&rsquo;s nerves. It can&rsquo;t be helped, I
      suppose. It&rsquo;s part of the system.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t help being your mother-in-law, Clare.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, it can&rsquo;t he helped,&rdquo; said Clare.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Heywood came close to her and touched her hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You think I do not understand. You think you are the only one who has any
      grievance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no!&rdquo; said Clare. &ldquo;I am not so egotistical.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Heywood smoothed down her dress with trembling hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You think I haven&rsquo;t been watching you all these years. I have watched you
      so that I know your thoughts behind those brooding eyes, Clare. I know all
      that you have been thinking and suffering, so that sometimes you hate me,
      so that my very presence here in the room with you makes you wish to cry
      out, to shriek, because I am your mother-in-law, and the mother of your
      husband. The husband always loves his mother best, and the wife always
      knows it. That is the eternal tragedy of the mother-in-law. Because she is
      hated by the wife of her son, and is an intruder in her home. I know that
      because I too suffered from a mother-in-law. Do you think I would stay
      here an hour unless I was forced to stay, for a shelter above my old head,
      for some home in which I wait to die? But while I wait I watch... and I
      know that you have reached a dangerous stage in a woman&rsquo;s life, when she
      may do any rash thing. Clare, I pray every night that you may pass that
      stage in life without doing anything&mdash;rash. This time always comes in
      marriage, it comes&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In the Eighth Year?&rdquo; asked Clare eagerly. &ldquo;Somewhere about then.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! I thought so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It came to me, my dear.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And did <i>you</i> do anything rash?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Heywood hesitated a moment before replying.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I gave birth to Herbert,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good Heavens!&rdquo; said Clare.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It saved me from breaking&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Windows, mother?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, my own and my husband&rsquo;s heart,&rdquo; said Mrs. Heywood. &ldquo;Well, I will go
      and speak to Mollie again. Goodness knows how we shall get coffee
      to-night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She went out of the room with her head shaking a little after this scene
      of emotion.
    </p>
    <p>
      Clare spoke to herself aloud. She had her hands up to her throat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want coffee to-night. I want stronger drink. I want to get drunk
      with liberty of life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly there was a noise at the window and the woman looked up,
      startled, and cried, &ldquo;Who is there?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Gerald Bradshaw appeared at the open French window leading on to the
      balcony, and he spoke through the window.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is I, Clare? Are you alone?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Clare had risen from her chair at the sound of his voice, and her face
      became very pale.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gerald... How did you come there?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Gerald Bradshaw laughed in his lighthearted way.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I stepped over the bar that divides our balconies. It was quite easy. It
      was as easy as it will be to cross the bar that divides you and me,
      Clare.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Clare spoke in a frightened voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why do you come here, at this hour?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why do I ever come?&rdquo; asked Gerald Bradshaw.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s because I want you. I want you badly to-night, Clare. I can&rsquo;t wait
      for you any longer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Clare spoke pleadingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gerald... go away... it&rsquo;s so dangerous... I daren&rsquo;t listen to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I want you to listen,&rdquo; said Gerald Bradshaw.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go away... I implore you to go away.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He laughed at her. He seemed very much amused.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not before I have said what I want to say.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Say it quickly,&rdquo; said Clare. &ldquo;Quickly!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s time enough,&rdquo; said Bradshaw. &ldquo;This is what I want to say. You are
      a lonely woman and I am a lonely man, and only an iron bar divides us.
      It&rsquo;s the iron bar of convention, of insincerity, of superstition. It seems
      so difficult to cross. But you see one step is enough. I want you to take
      that step&mdash;to-night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Clare answered him in a whisper.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go away!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am hungry for you,&rdquo; said Bradshaw, with a thrill in his voice. &ldquo;I am
      hungry for your love. And you are hungry for me. I have seen it in your
      eyes. You have the look of a famished woman. Famished for love. Famished
      for comradeship.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Clare raised her hands despairingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you have any pity, go away.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have no pity. Because pity is weakness, and I hate weakness.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are brutal,&rdquo; said Clare.
    </p>
    <p>
      He laughed at her. He seemed to like those words.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I have the brutality of manhood. Man is a brute, and woman likes the
      brute in him because that is his nature, and woman wants the natural man.
      That is why you want me, Clare. You can&rsquo;t deny it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Clare protested feebly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do deny it. I <i>must</i> deny it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a funny thing,&rdquo; said Gerald Bradshaw. &ldquo;Between you and me there is a
      queer spell, Clare. I was conscious of it when I first met you. Something
      in you calls to me. Something in me calls to you. It is the call of the
      wild.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Clare was scared now. These words seemed to make her heart beat to a
      strange tune.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is the call of the untamed creature. Both you and I are untamed. We
      both have the spirit of the woods. I am Pan. You are a wood nymph,
      imprisoned in a cage, upholstered by maple, on the hire system.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you want with me?&rdquo; asked Clare. It was clear that he was tempting
      her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I want to play with you, like Pan played. You and I will hear the pipes
      of Pan to-night&mdash;the wild nature music.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To-night?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To-night. I have waited too long for you, and now I&rsquo;m impatient. I am
      alone in my flat waiting for you. I ask you to keep me company, not
      to-night only, but until we tire of each other, until perhaps we hate each
      other. Who knows?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, God!&rdquo; said Clare. She moaned out the words in a pitiful way.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have only to slip down one flight of stairs and steal up another, and
      you will find me at the door with a welcome. It will need just a little
      care to escape from your prison. You must slip on your hat and cloak as
      though you were going round to church, and then come to me, to me, Clare!
      Only a wall will divide you from this flat, but you will be a world away.
      For you will have escaped from this upholstered cage into a little world
      of liberty. Into a little world of love, Clare. Say you will come!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, God!&rdquo; moaned Clare.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will come?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you the Devil that you tempt me?&rdquo; said Clare.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gerald gave a triumphant little laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will come! Clare, my sweetheart, I know you will come, for your
      spirit is ready for me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As he spoke these words there was the sound of a bell ringing through the
      flat, and the noise of it struck terror into Clare Heywood.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go away,&rdquo; she whispered. &ldquo;For God&rsquo;s sake go! Some one is ringing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will cross the bar again,&rdquo; said Bradshaw. &ldquo;But I shall be waiting at
      the door. You will not be very long, little one?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Clare sank down with her face in her hands. And Gerald stole away from the
      window just as Mollie showed in Madge Vernon.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s our At Home night,&rdquo; said Mollie, as she came in, &ldquo;and they&rsquo;ll be
      here presently.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right, Mollie,&rdquo; said Miss Vernon, smiling. &ldquo;I shan&rsquo;t stay more than a
      minute. I know I have come at an awkward time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She <i>would</i> come in, ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; said Mollie, as though she were not
      strong enough to thwart such a determined visitor.
    </p>
    <p>
      As soon as the girl had gone Madge Vernon came across to Clare, very
      cheerfully and rather excitedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Clare, are you coming?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Coming where?&rdquo; asked Clare, trying to hide her agitation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To the demonstration,&rdquo; said Madge Vernon. &ldquo;You know I told you all about
      it! It begins at eight. It will be immense fun, and after your
      window-smashing exploit you are one of us. Good Heavens, I think you have
      beaten us all. None of us have ever thought of breaking our own windows.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s my At Home night,&rdquo; said Clare.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, bother the At Home. Can&rsquo;t your husband look after his friends for
      once? I wanted you to join in this adventure. It would be your enrolment
      in the ranks, and it will do you a lot of good, in your present state of
      health.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In any case&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; said Clare.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Clare smiled in a tragic way.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have received a previous invitation.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, drat the invitation.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course I should have liked to come,&rdquo; said Clare, &ldquo;but&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Madge Vernon was impatient with her. &ldquo;But what? I hate that word &lsquo;but.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The spirit is willing but the flesh is weak,&rdquo; said Clare, speaking with a
      deeper significance than appeared in the words.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is no weakness about you. You have the courage of your convictions.
      Have you had the window mended yet?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She laughed gaily and then listened with her head a little on one side to
      the sound of a bell ringing in the hall.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That must be Herbert,&rdquo; said Clare. &ldquo;I think you had better go.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I think I had better,&rdquo; said Madge, laughing again. &ldquo;If looks could
      kill&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She went toward the door and opened it, but I stood on the threshold
      looking back.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Won&rsquo;t you come? Eight o&rsquo;clock, you know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Clare smiled weakly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am in great demand to-night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The two women listened to Herbert&rsquo;s voice in the hall saying&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course all the shops were shut.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Lord!&rdquo; said Madge, &ldquo;I must skedaddle.&rdquo; She went out of the room
      hurriedly, leaving Clare alone.
    </p>
    <p>
      And after a moment or two Clare spoke aloud, with her hands clasped upon
      her breast.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wonder if the Devil is tempting me tonight?&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then Herbert entered with two whisky bottles.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I had to hunt all over the place,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then he saw that his wife was still in her afternoon frock, and his face
      flushed with anger.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What, aren&rsquo;t you dressed <i>yet?</i>... I think you might show some
      respect for my wishes, Clare.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am going to dress now,&rdquo; said Clare, and she rose and went into the
      bedroom.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Women are the very devil,&rdquo; said Herbert, unwrapping the whisky bottles.
    </p>
    <p>
      While he was busy with this his mother came in, having changed her dress.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I am glad you managed to get the whisky,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course nearly every blessed shop was shut,&rdquo; said Herbert. &ldquo;They always
      are when I run out of everything. It&rsquo;s this Radical Government, with its
      beastly Acts.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Heywood hesitated and then came across to her son and touched him on
      the arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think you had better come into the kitchen a moment, dear, and look
      after Mollie.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She hasn&rsquo;t broken anything else, has she?&rdquo; said Herbert anxiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, dear. But she has just cut her finger rather badly. She got in a
      temper with the sandwiches.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Herbert raised his hands to heaven.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why do these things always happen when Clare gives an At Home? I shall
      abolish these evenings altogether. They will drive me mad.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, they&rsquo;re very pleasant when they once begin,&rdquo; said Mrs. Heywood.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad you think so, mother. I am damned if I do. I was only saying to
      Clare to-night&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He stalked out of the room furiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Heywood stood for a few moments staring at the carpet. Her lips moved
      and her worn old hands plucked at her skirt.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Every time there is an At Home at this flat,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I get another
      white hair.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She moved toward the door and went out of the room, so that it was left
      empty.
    </p>
    <p>
      Outside in the street a piano-organ was playing a rag-time tune with a
      rattle of notes, and motor-cars were sounding their horns.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this little drawing-room in Intellectual Mansions, Battersea Park,
      there was silence, except for those vague sounds from without. There was
      no sign here of Fate&rsquo;s presence, summoning a woman to her destiny. No
      angel stood with a flaming sword to bar the way to a woman with a wild
      heart. The little ormolu clock ticking on the mantel-shelf did not seem to
      be counting the moments of a tragic drama. It was a very commonplace
      little room, and the flamboyant chintz on the sofa and chairs gave it an
      air of cheerfulness, as though this were one of the happy homes of
      England.
    </p>
    <p>
      Presently the bedroom door opened slowly, and Clare Heywood stood there
      looking into the drawing-room and listening. She was very pale, and was
      dressed in her outdoor things, as Gerald Bradshaw had asked her to dress,
      in her hat and cloak, so that she might slip out of the flat which he had
      called her prison.
    </p>
    <p>
      She came further into the room, timidly, like a hare frightened by the
      distant baying of the hounds.
    </p>
    <p>
      She raised her hands to her bosom, and spoke in a whisper:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;God forgive me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then she crossed the floor, listened for a moment intently at the door,
      and slipped out. A moment or two later one&rsquo;s ears, if they had been
      listening, would have heard the front door shut.
    </p>
    <p>
      Clare Heywood had escaped.
    </p>
    <p>
      A little while later Mrs. Heywood, her mother-in-law, came into the room
      again and went over to the piano to open it and arrange the music.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do hope Clare is getting dressed,&rdquo; she said, speaking to herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then Herbert came in, carrying a tray with decanter and glasses.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t Clare ready yet?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, dear. She won&rsquo;t be long.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t find the corkscrew,&rdquo; said Herbert, searching round for it, but
      failing to discover its whereabouts.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t it in the kitchen, dear?&rdquo; asked Mrs. Heywood.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not unless Mollie has swallowed it. It&rsquo;s just the sort of thing she would
      do&mdash;out of sheer spite.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t you use it the other day to open a tin of sardines?&rdquo; asked the old
      lady, cudgelling her brains.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did I?&rdquo; said Herbert. &ldquo;Oh, Lord, yes! I left it in the bathroom.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He went out of the room to find it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Heywood crossed over to the fire and swept up the grate.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Clare is a very long time to-night,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then Mollie came in carrying a tray with some plates of sandwiches. One of
      her fingers was tied up with a rag.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a good job the guests is late to-night,&rdquo; she remarked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, we are all very behind-hand,&rdquo; said Mrs. Heywood.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mollie dumped down the tray and gave vent to a little of her impertinent
      philosophy:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll never give an At Home when I&rsquo;m married. Blest if I do. Social
      &lsquo;ipocrisy, I call them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Heywood rebuked her sharply:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t want your opinion, Mollie, thank you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose I can <i>have</i> a few opinions, although I <i>am</i> in
      service,&rdquo; said Mollie. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s plenty of time for thought even in the
      kitchen of a flat like this. I wonder domestic servants don&rsquo;t write
      novels. My word, what a revelation it would be! I&rsquo;ve a good mind to write
      one of them serials in the <i>Daily Mail</i>.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I have any more of your impudence, Mollie&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not impudence,&rdquo; said Mollie. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s aspirations.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The girl was silent when her master came into the room with the corkscrew.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It wasn&rsquo;t in the bathroom,&rdquo; he explained. &ldquo;I remember now, I used it for
      cleaning out my pipe.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I could have told you that a long time ago, sir,&rdquo; said Mollie.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, why the dickens didn&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; asked Herbert.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You never asked me, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mollie retired with the air of having scored a point.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, as long as you&rsquo;ve found it, dear,&rdquo; said Mrs. Heywood.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Unfortunately, I broke the point. However, I daresay I can make it do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He pulled one of the corks out of the whisky bottle and filled the
      decanter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hasn&rsquo;t Clare finished dressing yet?&rdquo; he said presently. &ldquo;What on earth is
      she doing?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I expect she wants her blouse done up at the back,&rdquo; said Mrs. Heywood.
    </p>
    <p>
      Herbert jerked up his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And then she complains because I can&rsquo;t tie my own tie I Just like women.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He drew out another cork rather violently and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, go and see after her, mother.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Heywood went toward the bedroom door and called out in her silvery
      voice:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you ready, dear?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She listened for a moment, and called out again:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Clare!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Herbert poured some more whisky into the decanter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I expect she&rsquo;s reading one of those beastly pamphlets,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Heywood tapped at the bedroom door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Clare!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go in, mother,&rdquo; said Herbert irritably.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s very strange!&rdquo; said Mrs. Heywood in an anxious voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      She went into the bedroom, and Herbert, who had been watching her, spilled
      some of the whisky, so that he muttered to himself:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What with women and what with whisky&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He did not finish his sentence, but stared in the direction of the bedroom
      as though suspecting something was wrong.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Heywood came trembling out. She had a scared look.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Herbert!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Herbert was alarmed by the look on her face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is Clare ill&mdash;or something?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She isn&rsquo;t there,&rdquo; said Mrs. Heywood.
    </p>
    <p>
      The old lady was rather breathless.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not there!&rdquo; said Herbert in a dazed way.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She went in to dress a few minutes ago,&rdquo; said his mother.
    </p>
    <p>
      Herbert stared at her. He was really very much afraid, but he spoke
      irritably:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, she can&rsquo;t have gone up the chimney, can she? At least, I suppose
      not, though you never can tell nowadays.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He strode toward the bedroom door and called out:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Clare!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then he went inside.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Heywood stood watching the open door. She raised her hands up and
      then let them fall, and spoke in a hoarse kind of whisper:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think it has happened at last.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Herbert came out of the bedroom again. He looked pale, and had gloomy
      eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s devilish queer!&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mother and son stood looking at each other, as though in the presence of
      tragedy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She must have gone out,&rdquo; said Mrs. Hey-wood.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gone out! What makes you think so?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She has taken her hat and cloak.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How do you know?&rdquo; asked Herbert.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I looked in the wardrobe.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good Heavens! Where&rsquo;s she gone to?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Heywood&rsquo;s thin old hands clutched at the white lace upon her bosom.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Herbert, I&mdash;I am afraid.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The man went deadly white. He stammered as he spoke:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t mean that she is going to do something&mdash;foolish?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Something rash,&rdquo; said Mrs. Hey wood mournfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      Herbert had a sudden idea. It took away from his fear a little and made
      him angry.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps she has gone round to church. If so, I will give her a piece of
      my mind when she comes back. It&rsquo;s outrageous! It&rsquo;s shameful.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was the sound of a bell ringing through the hall, and the mother and
      son listened intently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps she <i>has</i> come back,&rdquo; said Herbert. &ldquo;Perhaps she went to
      fetch some flowers.&rdquo; This idea seemed to soften him. His voice broke a
      little when he said: &ldquo;Poor girl! I didn&rsquo;t mean to make such a fuss about
      them.&rdquo; &ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t Clare,&rdquo; said Mrs. Heywood, shaking her head. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a
      visitor. I hear Mr. Atkinson Brown&rsquo;s voice.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Atkinson Brown&rsquo;s voice could be heard quite plainly in the hall:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Mollie, is your mistress quite well?&rdquo; Herbert grasped his mother&rsquo;s
      arm and whispered to her excitedly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mother, we must hide it from them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Mrs. Heywood. &ldquo;If the Atkinson Browns suspect anything it will
      be all over the neighborhood.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Herbert had a look of anguish in his eyes. &ldquo;Good Heavens, yes. My
      reputation will be ruined.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Once again they heard Mr. Atkinson Brown&rsquo;s voice in the hall.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see we are the first to arrive,&rdquo; he said in a loud, cheery tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mother,&rdquo; whispered Herbert, &ldquo;we must keep up appearances, at all costs.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll try to, darling,&rdquo; said Mrs. Heywood, clasping his arm for a moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      Herbert made a desperate effort to be hopeful.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Clare is sure to be back in a few minutes. We&rsquo;re frightening ourselves
      for nothing.... I shall have something to say to her to-night when the
      guests are gone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Heywood&rsquo;s eyes filled with tears, and she looked at her son as though
      she knew that Clare would never come back.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My poor boy!&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Play the game, mother,&rdquo; said Herbert. &ldquo;For Heaven&rsquo;s sake play the game.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He had no sooner whispered these words than Mr. and Mrs. Atkinson Brown
      entered the room, having taken off their outdoor things. Mr. Brown was a
      tall, stout, heavily built man with a bald head and a great expanse of
      white waistcoat. His wife was a little bird-like woman in pink silk. They
      were both elaborately cheerful.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hulloh, Heywood, my boy!&rdquo; said the elderly man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So delighted to come!&rdquo; said Mrs. Atkinson Brown to Herbert&rsquo;s mother.
    </p>
    <p>
      Herbert grasped the man&rsquo;s hand and wrung it warmly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good of you to come. Devilish good.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Glad to come,&rdquo; said Mr. Atkinson Brown. &ldquo;Glad to come, my lad. How&rsquo;s the
      wife?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Mrs. Atkinson Brown, glancing round the room. &ldquo;Where&rsquo;s dear
      Clare?... Well, I hope.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Herbert tried to hide his extreme nervousness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, tremendously fit, thanks. She&rsquo;ll be here in a minute or two.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Heywood appeared less nervous than her son. Yet her voice trembled a
      little when she said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do sit down, Mrs. Atkinson Brown.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She pulled a chair up, but the lady protested laughingly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, not so near the fire. I can&rsquo;t afford to neglect my complexion at my
      time of life!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her husband was rubbing his hands in front of the fire. He had no
      complexion to spoil.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Horrible weather for this time o&rsquo; year,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Damnable,&rdquo; said Herbert, agreeing with him almost too cordially.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is dear Clare suited at present?&rdquo; asked the lady.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Mrs. Heywood, &ldquo;we still have Mollie, but she is a great
      trouble&mdash;a very great trouble.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, the eternal servant problem!&rdquo; said Mrs. Atkinson Brown. &ldquo;I thought I
      had a perfect jewel, but I found her inebriated in the kitchen only
      yesterday.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Herbert was racking his brains for conversational subjects. He fell back
      on an old one. &ldquo;Business going strong?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Business!&rdquo; said Mr. Atkinson Brown. &ldquo;My dear boy, business has been the
      very devil since this Radical Government has been in power.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am sure there has been a great deal of trouble in the world lately,&rdquo;
       said Mrs. Heywood.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure I can&rsquo;t bear to read even the dear <i>Daily Mail</i>,&rdquo; said Mrs.
      Atkinson Brown.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What with murders and revolutions and eloping vicars and suffragettes&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Those outrageous women ought to be whipped,&rdquo; said her husband. &ldquo;Spoiled
      my game of golf last Saturday. Found &lsquo;Votes for Women&rsquo; on the first green.
      Made me positively ill.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am glad dear Clare is so sensible,&rdquo; said Mrs. Atkinson Brown.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. Oh, quite so,&rdquo; said Mrs. Heywood, flushing a little.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, rather!&rdquo; said Herbert.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We domestic women are in the minority now,&rdquo; said Mrs. Atkinson Brown.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The spirit of revolt is abroad, Herbert,&rdquo; said her husband. &ldquo;Back to the
      Home is the only watchword which will save the country from these
      shameless hussies. Flog &lsquo;em back, I would. Thank God <i>our</i> wives have
      more sense.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, there&rsquo;s something in that,&rdquo; said Herbert.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Atkinson Brown was gazing round the room curiously. She seemed to
      suspect something.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are sure dear Clare is quite well?&rdquo; she asked. &ldquo;No little trouble?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She is having a slight trouble with her back hair,&rdquo; said Herbert. &ldquo;Won&rsquo;t
      lie down, you know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He laughed loudly, as though he had made a good joke.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Atkinson Brown half rose from her chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, let me go to the rescue of the dear thing!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Herbert was terror-stricken.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No&mdash;no! It was only my joke,&rdquo; he said eagerly. &ldquo;She will be here in
      a minute. Do sit down.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Heywood remembered her promise to &ldquo;play the game.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Won&rsquo;t you sing something, dear?&rdquo; she said to her visitor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, not so early in the evening,&rdquo; said the lady. &ldquo;Besides, I have a most
      awful cold.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;m so sorry,&rdquo; said Herbert. &ldquo;I am beastly sorry.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As he spoke the bell rang again, and Herbert went over to his mother and
      whispered to her:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you think that is Clare? My God, this is awful!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Clare was not looking very well the other day when I saw her,&rdquo; said Mrs.
      Atkinson Brown. &ldquo;I thought perhaps she was sickening for something.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I assure you she was never better in her life,&rdquo; said Herbert.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you men are so unobservant. I am dying to see dear Clare, to ask her
      how she feels. Are you sure I can&rsquo;t be of any use to her?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She rose again from her chair, and Herbert gave a beseeching look to his
      mother.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, quite sure, dear,&rdquo; said Mrs. Heywood. &ldquo;<i>Do</i> sit down.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Besides, you have such a frightful cold,&rdquo; said Herbert, with extreme
      anxiety. &ldquo;<i>Do</i> keep closer to the fire.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Atkinson Brown laughed a little curiously:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You seem very anxious to keep me from dear Clare!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This persistence annoyed her husband and he rebuked her sternly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sit still, Beatrice, can&rsquo;t you? Don&rsquo;t you see that we have arrived a
      little early and that we have taken Clare unawares? Let the poor girl go
      on with her dressing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t bully me in other people&rsquo;s flats, Charles,&rdquo; said Mrs. Atkinson
      Brown. &ldquo;I have enough of it at home.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her husband was not to be quelled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Herbert and I can hardly hear ourselves speak,&rdquo; he growled, &ldquo;you keep up
      such a clatter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Atkinson Brown flared up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I come out to get the chance of speaking a little. For eight years now I
      have been listening to your interminable monologues, and can&rsquo;t get a word
      in edgeways.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stuff and nonsense!&rdquo; said her husband.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you been married eight years already, my dear?&rdquo; asked Mrs. Heywood
      in a tone of amiable surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, we are in our Eighth Year,&rdquo; said Mrs. Atkinson Brown.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Heywood seemed startled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I see,&rdquo; she said thoughtfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I assure you it seems longer,&rdquo; said the lady. &ldquo;I suppose it&rsquo;s because
      Charles makes me so very tired sometimes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Two other visitors now arrived. They were Mr. Hargreaves and his wife: the
      former a young man in immaculate evening clothes, with lofty manners; the
      latter a tall, thin, elegant, bored-looking woman, supercilious and
      snobbish.
    </p>
    <p>
      Herbert went forward hurriedly to his new guests.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How splendid of you to come! How are you, sir?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, pretty troll-loll, thanks,&rdquo; said Mr. Hargreaves.
    </p>
    <p>
      Herbert shook hands with Mrs. Hargreaves.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How do you do?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We&rsquo;re rather late,&rdquo; said the lady, &ldquo;but this is in an out-of-the-way
      neighborhood, is it not?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, do you think so?&rdquo; said Herbert. &ldquo;I always considered Battersea Park
      very central.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Hargreaves raised her eyebrows.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s having to get across the river that makes the journey so very
      tedious. I should die if I had to live across the river.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s something in what you say,&rdquo; said Herbert, anxious to agree with
      everybody. &ldquo;I must apologize for dragging you all this way. Of course, you
      people in Mayfair&mdash;&mdash;Won&rsquo;t you sit down?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Hargreaves became a victim of mistaken identity, shaking hands with
      Mrs. Atkinson Brown.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mrs. Heywood, I presume. I must introduce myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Hargreaves also greeted the other lady, under the same impression.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, how do you do? So delighted to make your acquaintance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Atkinson Brown was much amused, and laughed gaily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I am <i>not</i> Mrs. Heywood. I cannot boast of such a handsome
      husband!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, can&rsquo;t you, by Jove!&rdquo; said Mr. Atkinson Brown, rather nettled by his
      wife&rsquo;s candor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I beg pardon,&rdquo; said Mr. Hargreaves. &ldquo;Where <i>is</i> Mrs. Heywood?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, where is Mrs. Heywood?&rdquo; said his wife.
    </p>
    <p>
      Herbert looked wildly at his mother.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where is she, mother? Do tell her to hurry up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, dear,&rdquo; said Mrs. Heywood meekly. She moved uncertainly toward the
      bedroom door, and then hesitated: &ldquo;Perhaps she will not be very long now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The fact is,&rdquo; said Herbert desperately, &ldquo;she is not very well.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Atkinson Brown was astounded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you said she was perfectly well!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did I?&rdquo; said Herbert. &ldquo;Oh, well, er&mdash;one has to say these things,
      you know. Polite fictions, eh?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He laughed nervously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The fact is, she has a little headache. Hasn&rsquo;t she, mother?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, dear,&rdquo; said Mrs. Heywood. &ldquo;You know best.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Atkinson Brown rose from her chair again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I will go and see how the poor dear feels. So bad of you to hide it
      from us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, please sit down,&rdquo; said Herbert in a voice of anguish. &ldquo;I assure you
      it is nothing very much. She will be in directly. Make yourself at home,
      Mrs. Hargreaves. This chair? Mother, show Mrs. Atkinson Brown Clare&rsquo;s
      latest photograph.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes!&rdquo; said Mrs. Heywood. &ldquo;It is an excellent likeness.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I want to see Clare herself!&rdquo; said Mrs. Atkinson Brown plaintively.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sit down, Beatrice!&rdquo; said her husband.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bully!&rdquo; said Mrs. Atkinson Brown, sitting down with a flop.
    </p>
    <p>
      Herbert addressed himself to Mr. Hargreaves.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Draw up your chair, sir. You will have a cigar, I am sure.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He offered him one from a newly opened box. Mr. Hargreaves took one,
      smelled it, and then put it back.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, thanks,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I will have one of my own, if I may. Sure the
      ladies don&rsquo;t mind?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, they like it,&rdquo; said Herbert.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We have to pretend to,&rdquo; said Mrs. Hargreaves.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, if you don&rsquo;t, you ought to,&rdquo; said her husband. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a man&rsquo;s
      privilege.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Hargreaves smiled icily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One of his many privileges.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you have a cigarette, Mrs. Hargreaves?&rdquo; said Herbert.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Mr. Hargreaves interposed:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t allow my wife to smoke. It&rsquo;s a beastly habit.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Atkinson Brown, who had accepted one of Herbert&rsquo;s cigars, but after
      some inquiry had also decided to smoke one of his own, applauded this
      sentiment with enthusiasm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hear, hear! Hear, hear! Disgusting habit for women.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course I agree with you,&rdquo; said Herbert. &ldquo;Clare never smokes. But I
      don&rsquo;t lay down the law for other people&rsquo;s wives.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Hargreaves laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A very sound notion, Heywood. It takes all one&rsquo;s time to manage one&rsquo;s
      own, eh?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And then it is not always effective,&rdquo; said his wife. &ldquo;Even the worm will
      turn.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Hargreaves answered his wife with a heavy retort:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If it does I knock it on the head with a spade.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Atkinson Brown laughed loudly again. He seemed to like this man
      Hargreaves.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good epigram! By Jove, I must remember that!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Herbert was on tenter-hooks when the conversation languished a little.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Won&rsquo;t you sing a song, Mrs. Atkinson Brown? I am sure my friend, Mr.
      Hargreaves, will appreciate your voice.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, rather!&rdquo; said Hargreaves. &ldquo;Though I don&rsquo;t pretend to understand a
      note of music.&rdquo; Mrs. Atkinson Brown shook her head:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t think of singing before our hostess appears.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The lady&rsquo;s husband seemed at last to have caught the spirit of her
      suspicion. He spoke in a hoarse whisper to his wife:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where the devil <i>is</i> the woman?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Herbert Heywood realized that he was on the edge of a precipice. Not much
      longer could he hold on to this intolerable situation. He tried to speak
      cheerfully, but there was anguish in his voice when he said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, let&rsquo;s have a game of nap.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Lord, no,&rdquo; said Hargreaves. &ldquo;I only play nap on the way to a race.
      You don&rsquo;t sport a billiard table, do you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Herbert Heywood was embarrassed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Er&mdash;a billiard table?&rdquo; He looked round the room as though he might
      discover a billiard table. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid not.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be absurd, Edward,&rdquo; said Mrs. Hargreaves. &ldquo;People don&rsquo;t play
      billiards on the wrong side of the river.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Conversation languished again, and Herbert was becoming desperate. He
      seized upon the sandwiches and handed them round.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Won&rsquo;t anybody have a sandwich to pass the time away? Mrs. Hargreaves?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Hargreaves laughed in her supercilious way.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s rather early, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good Lord, no!&rdquo; said Herbert. &ldquo;I am sure you must be hungry. Let me beg
      of you&mdash;Mother, haven&rsquo;t you got any cake anywhere?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, dear,&rdquo; said Mrs. Heywood. She, too, was suffering mental tortures.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Atkinson Brown. You will have a sandwich,&rdquo; said Herbert.
    </p>
    <p>
      He bent over to his visitor and spoke in a gloomy voice:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take one, for God&rsquo;s sake.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Atkinson Brown was startled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes! Yes! By all means,&rdquo; he said hastily. Herbert handed the sandwiches
      about rather wildly. &ldquo;Mother, you will have one, won&rsquo;t you? Mrs. Atkinson
      Brown?... And one for me, eh?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Hargreaves eyed her host curiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope your wife is not seriously unwell, Mr. Heywood.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Herbert was losing his nerve.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t we talk of something else?&rdquo; he said despairingly. &ldquo;What is your
      handicap at golf?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My husband objects to my playing golf,&rdquo; said the lady.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It takes women out of the home so much,&rdquo; said Hargreaves. &ldquo;Play with the
      babies is my motto for women.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Atkinson Brown shook her finger at him, and laughed in a shrill
      voice:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But supposing they haven&rsquo;t got any babies?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They ought to have &lsquo;em,&rdquo; said Hargreaves.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was Atkinson Brown who interrupted this interesting discussion, which
      promised to bring up the great problem of eugenics, so favored now as a
      drawing-room topic. He had been turning his sandwich this way and that,
      and he leaned forward to his host:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Excuse me, Herbert, old man. There&rsquo;s something the matter with this
      sandwich.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Something the matter with it?&rdquo; asked Herbert anxiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s covered with red spots,&rdquo; said Atkinson Brown.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Spots&mdash;what kind of spots?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Looks like blood,&rdquo; said Atkinson Brown, giving an uneasy guffaw. &ldquo;Suppose
      there hasn&rsquo;t been a murder in this flat?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      All the guests leaned forward and gazed at the sandwich.
    </p>
    <p>
      Herbert spoke in a tragic whisper to his mother:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mollie&rsquo;s finger!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then he explained the matter airily to the general company.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, it&rsquo;s a special kind of sandwich with the gravy outside. A new fad,
      you know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I see,&rdquo; said Atkinson Brown, much relieved. &ldquo;Hadn&rsquo;t heard of it.
      Still, I think I&rsquo;ll have an ordinary one, if you don&rsquo;t mind.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Herbert was muttering little prayers remembered from his childhood.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mrs. Hargreaves,&rdquo; he said cajolingly, &ldquo;I am sure you play. Won&rsquo;t you give
      us a little tune?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, if it won&rsquo;t disturb your wife,&rdquo; said the lady.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I am sure it won&rsquo;t. She&rsquo;ll love to hear you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He felt immensely grateful to this good-natured woman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Edward, get my music-roll,&rdquo; said Mrs. Hargreaves.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Herbert had a horrible disappointment when Hargreaves said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By Jove! I believe I left it in the taxi. Yes, I am sure I did!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Herbert put his hand up to his aching head and whispered his anguish:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, my God! Now how shall I mark time?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I reminded you about it!&rdquo; said Mrs. Hargreaves.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I know. But you are always reminding me about something.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, play something by heart,&rdquo; said Herbert in a pleading way. &ldquo;Any old
      thing. The five-finger exercises.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am very out of practice,&rdquo; said Mrs. Hargreaves. &ldquo;But still I will try.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Herbert breathed a prayer of thankfulness, and hurried to conduct the lady
      to the music-stool.
    </p>
    <p>
      As he did so there was a noise outside the window. Newspaper men were
      shouting their sing-song: &ldquo;Raid on the &lsquo;Ouse. Suffragette Outrage. Raid on
      the &lsquo;Ouse of Commins.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What are the devils saying?&rdquo; asked Hargreaves, trying to catch the words.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Something about the Suffragettes,&rdquo; growled Atkinson Brown.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid it will give poor Clare a worse headache,&rdquo; said Mrs. Atkinson
      Brown.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Heywood tried to be reassuring:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t think so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At that moment there was a loud ring at the bell. The sound was so
      prolonged that it startled the company.
    </p>
    <p>
      Herbert listened intently and then whispered to his mother:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That must be Clare!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, if it is only Clare!&rdquo; said Mrs. Heywood. When Mrs. Hargreaves had
      struck a few soft chords on the piano there was the sound of voices
      speaking loudly in the hall. Everybody listened, surprised at the
      interruption. Mollie&rsquo;s voice could be heard quite clearly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I told you it was our At Home night, Miss Vernon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t help that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The drawing-room door opened, <i>sans ceremonie</i>, and Madge Vernon came
      in. Her face was flushed, and she had sparkling eyes. She stood in the
      doorway looking at the company with a smile, as though immensely amused by
      some joke of her own.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry to interrupt you good people,&rdquo; she said very cheerfully, &ldquo;but I
      have come on urgent business, which brooks no delay, as they say in
      melodrama.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Heywood gazed at her with frightened eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear!... What has happened?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo; said Herbert, turning very pale.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, it&rsquo;s nothing to be alarmed at,&rdquo; said Madge Vernon. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s about your
      wife.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My wife?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;About Clare?&rdquo; exclaimed Mrs. Atkinson Brown.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Hargreaves craned her head forward, like a bird reaching for its
      seed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wonder&mdash;&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Madge Vernon grinned at them all.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;ll be in the papers to-morrow, so you are all bound to know. Besides,
      why keep it a secret? It&rsquo;s a thing to be proud of!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Proud of what?&rdquo; asked Herbert in a frenzied tone of voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      Madge Vernon enjoyed the drama of her announcement.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Clare has been arrested in a demonstration outside the House to-night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Arrested!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The awful word was spoken almost simultaneously by all the company in that
      drawingroom of Intellectual Mansions, S. W.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She&rsquo;s quite safe,&rdquo; said Madge Vernon calmly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve come to ask you to
      bail her out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Herbert&rsquo;s guests rose and looked at him in profound astonishment and
      indignation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you told us&mdash;&rdquo; cried Mrs. Atkinson Brown.
    </p>
    <p>
      Herbert Heywood gave a queer groan of anger and horror.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bail her out!... Oh, my God!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He sank down into his chair and held his head in his hands.
    </p>

      CHAPTER III
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">H</span>erbert Heywood was
      in the depths of an arm-chair reading the paper. Mrs. Heywood was on the
      other side of the fireplace with a book on her lap. But she was dozing
      over it, and her head nodded on to her chest. Herbert turned over the
      leaves of the paper and then studied the advertisements. He had a look of
      extreme boredom. Every now and then he yawned quietly and lengthily. At
      last he let the paper fall on to the floor, and uttered his thoughts
      aloud, so that his mother was awakened.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you say anything, Herbert?&rdquo; said the old lady.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing, mother, except that I am bored stiff.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He went over to the piano and played &ldquo;God Save the King&rdquo; with one finger,
      in a doleful way.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Heywood glanced over her spectacles at him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Would you like a game of cribbage, dear?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, thanks, mother,&rdquo; said Herbert hastily. &ldquo;Not in the afternoon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Heywood listened to his fumbling notes for a moment and then spoke
      again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Won&rsquo;t you go out for a walk? It would do you good, Herbert.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Think so?&rdquo; said Herbert bitterly; without accepting the suggestion, he
      played &ldquo;Three Blind Mice,&rdquo; also with one finger. It sounded more
      melancholy than &ldquo;God Save the King.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like to see you moping indoors on a bright day like this,&rdquo; said
      Mrs. Heywood. &ldquo;Take a brisk walk round the Park. It would cheer you up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Herbert resented the idea fiercely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A long walk in Battersea Park would make a pessimist of a laughing
      hyena.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Heywood was silent for some time, but then she made a last effort.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, go and see a friend, dear. The Atkinson Browns, for instance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They do nothing but nag at each other,&rdquo; said Herbert. &ldquo;And Atkinson Brown
      hasn&rsquo;t as much brains as a Teddy Bear. Besides, he&rsquo;s become friendly with
      that fellow Hargreaves, and I&rsquo;m not going to take the risk of meeting a
      man who turned me out of my job.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Heywood became agitated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you sure of that, Herbert? I can&rsquo;t think he could have been so
      malicious, after coming here and eating your salt, as it were. What was
      his reason?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He made no disguise of it,&rdquo; said Herbert bitterly. &ldquo;I saw his letter to
      my chief. Said that it was quite impossible to employ a man who was mixed
      up with the militant Suffragettes. Damned liar!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good Heavens!&rdquo; said Mrs. Heywood.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course it was all due to that ghastly evening when Clare got arrested.
      She knows that well enough.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, dear,&rdquo; said Mrs. Heywood, &ldquo;she has tried to make amends. The shock
      of your losing your place has made her much more gentle and loving. It has
      brought back all her loyalty to you, Herbert.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Loyalty!&rdquo; said Herbert. &ldquo;Where is she now, I should like to know?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She is gone to some committee meeting.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She&rsquo;s always got a committee meeting,&rdquo; said Herbert angrily, kicking the
      hassock.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She joins a new committee for some kind of social reform nonsense every
      blessed day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, it keeps her busy, dear,&rdquo; said Mrs. Heywood gently. &ldquo;Besides, it is
      not all committee work. Since she has been visiting the poor and helping
      in the slums she has been ever so much better in health and spirits.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, but where the devil do I come in?&rdquo; asked Herbert.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you think you might go out, dear? Just for a little while?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t <i>want</i> to go out, mother,&rdquo; said Herbert with suppressed
      heat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well, dear.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Herbert stood in front of the fireplace and rattled the keys in his pocket
      moodily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the good of toiling to keep a home together if one&rsquo;s wife abandons
      her husband&rsquo;s society on every possible pretext? A home! This place is
      just a receiving office for begging letters and notices for committees and
      subcommittees.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Heywood sighed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It might have been worse, Herbert.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As far as I&rsquo;m concerned, it couldn&rsquo;t be worse. I&rsquo;m the most miserable
      wretch in London. Without a job and without a wife.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll get a place all right, dear. You have the promise of one already.
      And you know Clare&rsquo;s health was in a very queer state before Miss Vernon
      made her take an interest in helping other people. I was seriously alarmed
      about her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What about me?&rdquo; asked Herbert. &ldquo;No one troubles to get alarmed about me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you unwell, dear?&rdquo; said Mrs. Hey-wood anxiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course I&rsquo;m unwell.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Darling!&rdquo; said Mrs. Heywood, still more anxiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, there&rsquo;s nothing the matter with me from a physical point of view. But
      mentally and morally I&rsquo;m a demnition wreck.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t you taking your iron pills regularly?&rdquo; said his mother.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pills! As if pills could cure melancholia!&rdquo; Mrs. Heywood was aghast at
      that dreadful word.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good Heavens, dear!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m on the verge of a nervous breakdown,&rdquo; said Herbert.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Herbert,&rdquo; cried his mother, &ldquo;I hope not!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m working up to a horrible crisis,&rdquo; said Herbert.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What are your symptoms? How do you feel?&rdquo; asked his mother.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I feel like smashing things,&rdquo; said Herbert savagely.
    </p>
    <p>
      He sat down at the piano again and played &ldquo;We Won&rsquo;t Go Home Till Morning,&rdquo;
       but missed his note, and banged on to the wrong one in a temper.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There goes a note, anyhow. Thank goodness for that!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At that moment Mollie came in holding a silver tray with a pile of
      letters.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The post, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, something to break the infernal monotony,&rdquo; said Herbert with a sigh
      of relief.
    </p>
    <p>
      He took up the letters and examined them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Life is a bit flat, sir,&rdquo; said Mollie, &ldquo;since we gave up having At
      Homes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hold your tongue,&rdquo; said Herbert.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mollie tossed her head and muttered an impertinent sentence as she left
      the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t even open my mouth without somebody jumping down my throat. I will
      break that girl&rsquo;s neck one of these days,&rdquo; said Herbert.
    </p>
    <p>
      He went through the letters and read out the names on them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mrs. Herbert Heywood, <i>Mrs.</i> Herbert Heywood, Mrs. Herbert Heywood,
      Mrs. Herbert&mdash;Why, every jack one is for Mrs. Herbert Heywood! Nobody
      writes to me, of course. No one cares a damn about <i>me</i>.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your mother cares, Herbert,&rdquo; said the old lady.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall take to drink&mdash;or the devil,&rdquo; said Herbert, and he added
      thoughtfully, &ldquo;I wonder which is the most fun?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Herbert, dear!&rdquo; cried his mother, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t say such awful things.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The worst of it is,&rdquo; said Herbert bitterly, &ldquo;they&rsquo;re both so beastly
      expensive.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was the noise of a latchkey in the hall, and Mrs. Heywood gave a
      little cry.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s Clare!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Think so?&rdquo; said Herbert, listening.
    </p>
    <p>
      From the hall came the sound of Clare&rsquo;s voice singing a merry tune.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She&rsquo;s in a cheerful mood, anyhow,&rdquo; said Mrs. Heywood, smiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      Herbert answered her gloomily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Horribly cheerful.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The mother and son looked toward the door as Clare came in. There was a
      noticeable change in her appearance since the evening At Home. There was
      more color in her cheeks and the wistfulness had gone out of her eyes. She
      was brisk, keen and bright.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, mother,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;been having a nap?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no, dear,&rdquo; said the old lady, who never admitted that she made a
      habit of naps.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hulloh, Herbert,&rdquo; said Clare. &ldquo;Have you got that new post yet?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Herbert. &ldquo;And I don&rsquo;t expect I shall get it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes, you will, dear old boy. Don&rsquo;t you worry! Have you been home
      long?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Seems like a lifetime.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Clare laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not so long as that, surely?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She came forward to him and put her arm about his neck, and offered him
      her cheek. He looked at it doubtfully for a moment and then kissed her in
      a &ldquo;distant&rdquo; manner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m frightfully busy, old boy,&rdquo; said Clare. &ldquo;I just have a few minutes
      and then I shall have to dash off again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dash off where?&rdquo; asked Herbert, with signs of extreme irritation. &ldquo;Dash
      it all, surely you aren&rsquo;t going out again?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Only round the corner,&rdquo; said Clare quietly. &ldquo;I have got to look into the
      case of a poor creature who is making match-boxes. Goodness knows how many
      for a farthing! And yet she&rsquo;s so cheerful and plucky that it does one good
      to see her. Oh, it kills one&rsquo;s own selfishness, Herbert.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, why worry about her, then, if she&rsquo;s so pleased with herself?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She&rsquo;s plucky,&rdquo; said Clare, &ldquo;but she&rsquo;s starving. It&rsquo;s a bad case of
      sweated labor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sweated humbug,&rdquo; said Herbert. &ldquo;What am I going to do all the evening, I
      should like to know? Sit here alone?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t suppose I shall be long,&rdquo; said Clare. &ldquo;Besides, there&rsquo;s mother.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, there&rsquo;s mother,&rdquo; said Herbert. &ldquo;But when a man&rsquo;s married he wants
      his wife.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Clare was now busy looking over her letters.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t you go to the club?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m dead sick of the club. That boiled-shirt Bohemianism is the biggest
      rot in the world.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take mother to the theatre,&rdquo; said Clare cheerfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The theatre bores me stiff. These modern plays set one&rsquo;s nerves on edge.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, haven&rsquo;t you got a decent novel or anything?&rdquo; said Clare, reading
      one of her letters.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A decent novel! There&rsquo;s no such thing nowadays, and they give me the
      hump.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Clare was reading another letter with absorbed interest, but she listened
      with half an ear, as it were, to her husband.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Play mother a game of cribbage, then,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look here, Clare,&rdquo; said Herbert furiously, &ldquo;I shall begin to throw things
      about in a minute.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t get hysterical, Herbert,&rdquo; said Clare calmly. &ldquo;Especially as I have
      got some good news for you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As she spoke these words she looked across a Demonstration to him with a
      curious smile and added: &ldquo;A big surprise, Herbert!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A surprise?&rdquo; said Herbert with sarcasm. &ldquo;Have you discovered another
      widow in distress?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I have,&rdquo; said Clare, &ldquo;but it&rsquo;s not that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Heywood glanced from her son to her daughter-in-law, and seemed to
      imagine that she might be disturbing an intimate conversation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will be back in a minute. I won&rsquo;t disturb you two dears,&rdquo; she said, as
      she left the room quietly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You won&rsquo;t disturb us, mother,&rdquo; said Clare.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the old lady smiled and said, &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t be long.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you going to get arrested again?&rdquo; asked Herbert. &ldquo;Do you want me to
      bail you out? Because by the Lord, I won&rsquo;t!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, that was quite an accident,&rdquo; said Clare, laughing. &ldquo;Besides, I gave
      you my word to abstain from the militant movement, and you can&rsquo;t say I
      have broken the pledge.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have broken a good many other things.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What kind of things?&rdquo; asked Clare. &ldquo;You aren&rsquo;t alluding to that window
      again, are you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have broken my illusions on married life,&rdquo; said Herbert, with tragic
      emphasis.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; said Clare, &ldquo;that is &lsquo;the Great Illusion,&rsquo; by the Angel in the
      House.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have broken my ideals of womanhood.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They were false ideals, Herbert,&rdquo; said Clare very quietly. &ldquo;It was only a
      plaster ideal which broke. The real woman is of flesh and blood. The real
      woman is so much better than the sham. Don&rsquo;t you think so?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It depends on what you call sham,&rdquo; said Herbert.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was a sham until that plaster image of me broke. I indulged in sham
      sentiment, sham emotion, sham thoughts. Look at me now, since I went
      outside these four walls and faced the facts of life, and saw other
      people&rsquo;s misery besides my own, and the happiness of people with so much
      more to bear than I had. Look into my eyes, Herbert.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She smiled at him tenderly, alluringly. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the good?&rdquo; said Herbert.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you see a weary soul looking out?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Herbert looked into his wife&rsquo;s eyes for a moment and then stared down at
      the carpet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I used to see love looking out,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s looking out now,&rdquo; said Clare. &ldquo;Love of life instead of discontent.
      Love of this great throbbing human nature, with so much to be put right.
      Love of poor people, and little children, and brave hearts. Madge Vernon
      taught me that, for she has a soul bigger than the suffrage, and ideals
      that go beyond the vote. I have blown the cobwebs out of my eyes, Herbert.
      I see straight.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How about <i>me?</i>&rdquo; asked Herbert. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s what I want to know. Where
      do I come in?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, you come in all right!&rdquo; said Clare. &ldquo;You are a part of life and have
      a big share of my love.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to be shared up, thanks,&rdquo; said Herbert.
    </p>
    <p>
      She stroked his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I love you much better now that I see you with this new straight vision
      of mine. At any rate I love what is real in you and not what is sham. And
      I have learned the duties of love, Herbert. I believe I am a better wife
      to you. I think I have learned the meaning of marriage, and of married
      love.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She spoke with a touch of emotion, and there was a thrill in her voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are in love with your social work and your whining beggars, not with
      me. You are getting farther and farther away from me. You leave me alone;
      I come back to a neglected home.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, Mollie and mother look after it beautifully,&rdquo; said Clare very
      cheerfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      Herbert gave expression to his grievances.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I come home and ask, &lsquo;Where is Clare?&rsquo; and get the eternal answer, &lsquo;Clare
      is out.&rsquo; I am an abandoned husband, and by Heaven I won&rsquo;t stand it. I will&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What, Herbert?&rdquo; said Clare, smiling up at him. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t do anything rash,
      old boy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&mdash;have a good mind to make love to somebody else&rsquo;s wife. But
      they&rsquo;re all so beastly ugly!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps somebody else&rsquo;s wife won&rsquo;t respond,&rdquo; said Clare. &ldquo;Some women are
      very cold.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take to drink. I have already given mother full warning.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am sure it will disagree with you, dear,&rdquo; said Clare.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You scoff at me,&rdquo; said Herbert passionately. &ldquo;I think we had better live
      apart.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You would get even more bored than before. Dear old boy. <i>Do</i> be
      reasonable. <i>Do</i> cultivate a sense of humor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is not a farce,&rdquo; said Herbert. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a horrible tragedy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take up a hobby or something,&rdquo; said Clare. &ldquo;Golf&mdash;or fretwork.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Herbert was furious.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fretwork! Is that a joke or an insult?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was only a suggestion!&rdquo; said Clare. Herbert jumped up from his chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I had better go and drown myself straight away...&rdquo;?
    </p>
    <p>
      He turned at the door, and gave a tragic look at his wife. &ldquo;Good-by.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Clare smiled at him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Won&rsquo;t you kiss me before you go?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will take my pipe,&rdquo; said Herbert, coming back to the mantelshelf. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
      my only friend.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It will go out in the water,&rdquo; said Clare. &ldquo;Besides, Herbert, don&rsquo;t you
      want to hear my good news? My big surprise?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Herbert. &ldquo;Nothing you could say or do could surprise me now. If
      mother wants me I shall be in the study for the rest of the evening.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I thought you were going to the river?&rdquo;, said Clare teasingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Herbert was not to be amused.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose you think you&rsquo;re funny? I don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then he went out and slammed the door. Clare was left alone, and there was
      a smile about her lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor old Herbert,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I think he will have the surprise of his
      life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She laughed quietly to herself, and then looked up and listened as she
      heard a slight noise. She stood up with a sudden look of anger as she saw
      Gerald Bradshaw gazing at her through the open French windows.
    </p>
    <p>
      The man spoke to her in his soft, silky voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Clare, why are you so cruel to me? I have been ill because of your
      heartlessness.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Clare answered him sternly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought I had got rid of you. Have you come back to plague me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I tried to forget you,&rdquo; said Gerald Bradshaw. &ldquo;I went as far as Italy to
      forget you. I made love to many women to forget you. But I have come back.
      And I shall always come back, because you are my mate and I cannot live
      without you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Clare&rsquo;s voice rang out in the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;God ought not to let you live. Every word you speak is a lie. You are a
      thief of women&rsquo;s honor. Get away from my window, because your very breath
      is poison.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The man was astonished, a little scared. &ldquo;You did not speak like that
      once, Clare. You let me hold your hand. You trembled when I leaned toward
      you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was ill and weak,&rdquo; said Clare, &ldquo;and you tried to tempt my weakness. I
      was blind and did not see the evil in you. But now I am well and strong,
      and my eyes are opened to the truth of things. If you don&rsquo;t go I will call
      my husband and he will throw you over that balcony at one word from me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Gerald Bradshaw laughed scoffingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your husband! I could kill him between my thumb and forefinger.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is strong because he is good,&rdquo; said Clare. &ldquo;I will call him now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She went quickly toward the bell.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You needn&rsquo;t call him,&rdquo; said Gerald Bradshaw. &ldquo;I would dislike to hurt the
      little man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are going?&rdquo; asked Clare.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I am going,&rdquo; said the man, &ldquo;because something has changed in you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Clare gave a cheerful little laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are right.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see that now. I have lost my spell over you. Something has broken.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you going,&rdquo; said Clare sternly, &ldquo;or shall I call my man?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am going, Clare,&rdquo; said the man at the window. &ldquo;I am going to find
      another mate. She and I will talk evil of you, and hate you, as I hate you
      now. Farewell, foolish one!&rdquo; He withdrew from the window, and instantly
      Clare rushed to it, shut it and bolted it. Then she pulled down the blind,
      and stood, panting, with her back to it and her arms outstretched.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;God be praised!&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;He has gone out of my life. I am a clean
      woman again.&rdquo; At that moment Mrs. Heywood entered. &ldquo;Must you go out again,
      Clare?&rdquo; said the old lady.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Only for a little while, mother,&rdquo; said Clare, a little breathless after
      her emotion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is anything the matter, dear?&rdquo; said Mrs. Heywood. &ldquo;You look rather
      flustered.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, nothing is the matter!&rdquo; said Clare. &ldquo;Only I am very happy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Heywood smiled at her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It makes me happy to see you so well and bright,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t get on your nerves so much, eh, mother?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She laughed quietly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I must go and tidy my hair.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She moved toward the bedroom, but stopped to pack up her letters.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am so sorry you have to go out,&rdquo; said the old lady.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shan&rsquo;t be more than a few minutes,&rdquo; said Clare. &ldquo;But I must go.
      Besides, after this I am going to <i>give</i> up some of my visiting
      work.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Give it up, dear?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. One must be moderate even in district visiting.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She went into the bedroom, but left the door open so that she could hear
      her mother.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Clare!&rdquo; said the old lady.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, mother.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is that surprise you were going to give us?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Surprise, mother?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Mrs. Heywood. &ldquo;The good news?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes, I forgot,&rdquo; said Clare. &ldquo;Come in and I will tell you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Heywood went into the bedroom. Outside, in the street, a man with a
      fiddle was playing the &ldquo;Intermezzo.&rdquo; Presently both women came out. Clare
      was smiling, with her arm round Mrs. Heywood&rsquo;s neck. Mrs. Heywood was
      wiping her eyes as though crying a little.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cheer up,&rdquo; said Clare. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s nothing to cry about.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am crying because I am so glad,&rdquo; said Mrs. Heywood.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, that&rsquo;s a funny thing to do,&rdquo; said Clare, laughing gaily. &ldquo;Now I
      must run away. You won&rsquo;t let Herbert drown himself, will you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, dear,&rdquo; said Mrs. Heywood, wiping her eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who would have thought it!&rdquo; said Mrs.
    </p>
    <p>
      Heywood, speaking to herself as her daughter-in-law left the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      She went over to the mantelpiece and took up her son&rsquo;s photograph and
      kissed it. Then she went to the door and stood out in the hall and called
      in a sweet old woman&rsquo;s voice:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Herbert! Herbert, dear!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you calling, mother?&rdquo; answered Herbert from another room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Mrs. Heywood. &ldquo;I want you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t feel a bit like cribbage, mother,&rdquo;&rsquo; said Herbert.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want you to play cribbage to-night,&rdquo; said the old lady. &ldquo;I have
      something to say to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Has Clare gone?&rdquo; asked Herbert, still calling from the other room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Mrs. Heywood. &ldquo;But she won&rsquo;t be long.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, all right. I&rsquo;ll be along in a moment.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Heywood went back into the room and waited for her son eagerly.
      Presently he came in with a pipe in his hand and book under his arm. He
      had changed into a shabby old jacket, and was in carpet slippers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter, mother?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s nothing the matter,&rdquo; said the old lady; then she became very
      excited, and raised her hands and cried out:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At least, everything is the matter. It&rsquo;s the only thing that matters! ...
      Oh, Herbert!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She laughed and cried at the same time so that her son was alarmed and
      stared at her in amazement.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You aren&rsquo;t ill, are you?&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Shall I send for a doctor?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Heywood shook her trembling old head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m quite well. I never felt so well.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You had better sit down, mother,&rdquo; said Herbert.
    </p>
    <p>
      He took her hand and led her to a chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s up, eh, old lady? Mollie hasn&rsquo;t run away, has she?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The old lady took his hand and fondled it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Herbert, my son, I&rsquo;ve wonderful news for you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;News?&rdquo; said Herbert. &ldquo;Did you find it in the evening paper?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s going to make a lot of difference to us all,&rdquo; said Mrs. Heywood. &ldquo;No
      more cribbage, Herbert!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank heaven for that!&rdquo; said Herbert.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And not so much social work for Clare.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, let&rsquo;s be thankful for small mercies,&rdquo; said Herbert.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bend your head down and let me whisper to you,&rdquo; said Mrs. Heywood.
    </p>
    <p>
      She put her hands up to his head, and drew it down, and whispered
      something into his ears.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was something which astounded him.
    </p>
    <p>
      He started back and said &ldquo;No!&rdquo; as though he had heard something quite
      incredible. Then he spoke in a whisper:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By Jove!... Is that a fact?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the best fact that ever was, Herbert,&rdquo; said the old lady.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes... it will make a bit of a difference,&rdquo; said Herbert thoughtfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Heywood clasped her son&rsquo;s arm. There was a tremulous light in her
      eyes and a great emotion in her voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Herbert, I am an old woman and your mother. Sit down and let me talk to
      you as I did in the old days when you were my small boy before a nursery
      fire.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Herbert smiled at her; all the gloom had left his face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right, mother.... By Jove, and I never guessed. And yet I ought to
      have guessed. Things have been&mdash;different&mdash;lately.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He sat down on a hassock near the old lady with his knees tucked up. She
      sat down, too, and stretched out a trembling hand to touch his hair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Once upon a time, Herbert, there was a young man and a young woman who
      loved each other very dearly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Herbert looked up and smiled at her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you sure, mother?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perfectly sure. Then they married.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And lived happily ever after? I bet they didn&rsquo;t!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, not quite happily, because this is different from the fairy tales.
      ... After a time the husband began to think too much about his work, while
      the wife stayed at home and thought too much about herself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a stale old yarn,&rdquo; said Herbert. &ldquo;What happened then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By degrees the wife began to think she hated her husband, because
      although he gave her little luxuries and pretty clothes, and all the
      things that pleased <i>him</i>, he never gave her the thing <i>she</i>
      wanted.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What was that?&rdquo; asked Herbert.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was a magic charm to make her forget herself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, magic charms aren&rsquo;t easy to find,&rdquo; said Herbert.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No.... But at last she went out to find it herself. And while she was
      away the husband came home and missed her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor devil!&rdquo; said Herbert. &ldquo;Of course he did.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Being a man,&rdquo; said Mrs. Heywood, giving a queer little laugh, &ldquo;he stayed
      at home more than he used to do, and then complained that he was left too
      much alone. Just like his wife had complained.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, hang it all,&rdquo; said Herbert, &ldquo;she ought to have stayed with him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But then she wouldn&rsquo;t have found the magic charm,&rdquo; said Mrs. Heywood.
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you see?... And she would have withered and withered away until
      there was nothing left of her, and the husband would have been quite alone&mdash;forever.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Think so?&rdquo; said Herbert very thoughtfully. &ldquo;D&rsquo;you think it would have
      been as bad as that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Mrs. Heywood. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, what did happen?&rdquo; asked Herbert. &ldquo;Did she find the magic charm? It
      wasn&rsquo;t a widow in distress, was it? Or Social Reform humbug?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Mrs. Heywood; &ldquo;that gave her a new interest in life because it
      helped her to forget herself, some of her own little worries, some of her
      brooding thoughts. But a good fairy who was looking after her worked
      another kind of magic.... Herbert I It&rsquo;s the best magic for unhappy women
      and unhappy homes, and it has been worked for you. Oh, my dear, you ought
      to be very thankful.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Herbert, scratching his head. &ldquo;Yes, I suppose so. But what&rsquo;s
      the moral of the tale, mother? I&rsquo;m hanged if I see.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Heywood put her hand on her son&rsquo;s shoulder, as he sat on the hassock
      by her chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a moral told by an old woman who watched these two from the very
      beginning. A husband mustn&rsquo;t expect his wife to stay at home for ever. The
      home isn&rsquo;t big enough, Herbert. There&rsquo;s the great world outside calling to
      her, calling, calling. The walls of a little fiat like this are too narrow
      for the spirit and heart. If he keeps her there she either pines and dies,
      or else&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What?&rdquo; asked Herbert.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Escapes, my dear,&rdquo; said the old lady very solemnly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Herbert drew a deep, quivering breath.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then,&rdquo; said Mrs. Heywood, &ldquo;nothing in the world can call her back&mdash;except&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Except what?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A little child.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Herbert got up from the hassock and clasped the mantelshelf, and spoke in
      a low, humble, grateful voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank God, Clare has been called back!&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Heywood rose from her chair also, and caught hold of her son&rsquo;s
      sleeve.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;yes. But even now she will want to spread her wings a
      little. She must take short flights, Herbert, even now. She must wing her
      way out to the big world at times. You will remember that, won&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll try to remember,&rdquo; said Herbert. He bent his head over his hands on
      the mantelshelf. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been selfish,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Blinded with selfishness
      and self-conceit. God forgive me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps we have all been a little selfish,&rdquo; said Mrs. Heywood quietly.
      &ldquo;But we shall have some one else to think about now. A new life, Herbert.
      A new life is coming to us all!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hush!&rdquo; said Herbert. &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s Clare.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The mother and son stood listening to the voice of Clare singing in the
      hall. She was singing the old nursery rhyme of&mdash;=
    </p>
    <p>
      ```"Sing a song of sixpence,
    </p>
    <p>
      ```A pocket-full of rye,
    </p>
    <p>
      ```Four and twenty blackbirds
    </p>
    <p>
      ```Baked in a pie,
    </p>
    <p>
      ```When the pie was opened&mdash;&mdash;-&ldquo;=
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Heywood smiled into her son&rsquo;s eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think I&rsquo;ve left my spectacles in the other room,&rdquo; she said. She went
      out into the hall, leaving her son alone.
    </p>
    <p>
      And Herbert stood with his head raised, looking toward the door, eagerly,
      like a lover waiting for his bride.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then Clare came in. There was a smile about her lips, and she spoke
      cheerfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, you see I wasn&rsquo;t long.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Herbert strode toward her and took her hands and raised them to his lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Clare, sweetheart! Is it true? Have you been called back to me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Clare put her forehead down against his chest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I never went very far away,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Presently Herbert spoke again with great cheerfulness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I say, Clare. It&rsquo;s a funny thing!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s a funny thing?&rdquo; asked Clare, smiling at him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, I was reading the advertisements in the paper to-night&mdash;-&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Were <i>they</i> funny?&rdquo; asked Clare.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Herbert, &ldquo;but I saw something that would just suit us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He went over to a side-table and picked up the newspaper. Sitting on the
      edge of the table, he read out an advertisement.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here it is.... &lsquo;Chelsea&mdash;Semi-detached house, dining-room,
      drawing-room, three bedrooms, and a large nursery. Shed for bicycle or
      perambulator.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Clare laughed happily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, we might have both!&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Herbert dropped the paper, came over to his wife, and kissed her hands
      again.
    </p>

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &ldquo;Defects,&rdquo; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm&rsquo;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation&rsquo;s EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state&rsquo;s laws.

The Foundation&rsquo;s principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
